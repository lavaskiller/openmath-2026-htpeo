## 0. Summary

- Mechanically verified pool: 63 rows / 56 distinct theorems / 36 Erdos-problem families, of which 61 rows pass (compile rc 0, statement textually identical to the pinned FC commit, axioms within [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]) and 2 are rejected (proof was already in FC); `verify_all.py` re-run 2026-10-02 14:16 UTC including the five 'advanced' sessions adv1..adv5.
- **Claimed set: 17 families** = 10 substantive (section 1: G-PM + 9 Erdos families, 15 Erdos theorems) + 7 minor/sanity (section 2, 7 theorems, team to decide). E477 (section 1.10) and E358, E619, E1148 (sections 2.5-2.7) were added on 2026-10-03; until then the claimed set was 13 families.
  - Substantive, ordered by level: G-PM (Schoenberger's theorem and Petersen's theorem, connected case, from the star6 library), E942, E44, E123, E918, E292, E395, E698, E939, E477
  - Minor / sanity: E295, E703, E748, E1136, E358, E619, E1148
- Optional, NOT claimed by default (section 3): 8 theorems in 5 families (E757, E261, E36, E649, E508) -- the FC statement has no prior formal proof that we could find, but the same mathematics was already formalized publicly under different definitions.
- **What changed against v1.** (a) New substantive families: G-PM and E942. (b) **Correction: E649 is moved from 'substantive' to 'optional'**: plby/lean-proofs already proves Sampaio's instance (and Tong's theorem) with its own definition of P(n); v1 was wrong to call it new. (c) Of the eight 'advanced' results produced on 2026-10-02 (E508 x2, E138, E942, E649 tong, E770, E273, E1136 mueller), the exhaustive prior-art pass found that **only E942 is new**: E508 `4 ≤ χ`, E138, E770, E273 are exact duplicates of JSP pull requests of 2026-09-16/17, E1136 mueller is plby's theorem (with plby code copied), E508 `χ ≤ 7` and E649 tong are formalized elsewhere under other definitions (optional). All eight are mechanically verified and are genuine proofs (section 4 and the notes in sections 1 and 3); they are simply not first formalizations.
- Excluded as duplicates (section 4): E508 `HadwigerNelsonAtLeast4`, E138, E770, E273, E1136 `mueller` (this pass); E1063, E859, E835, E1074, E1193, E282, E291, E302, E317, E367, E423, E865, E885, E1008 (earlier); inside claimed/optional families `erdos_698.variants.erdos_szekeres_sharp`, `erdos_1136.variants.upper_bound` and `HadwigerNelsonAtLeast4` stay proved in the files but are not claimed. E723 and E120 were skipped by the proving sessions as duplicates of conjectures-io contributions. E617 `r_eq_3`: still in progress (session adv5) when this packet was generated; not included.
- M2 counts families, not theorems (handbook 4.1). Each family below is one Erdos problem number; variants of one problem are never counted separately.
- Human review status: **none yet**. All proofs were written by an AI model and checked only by the Lean kernel and by scripts.

## 1. Substantive families (ordered by level)

### 1.1. Family G-PM -- Schoenberger's theorem and Petersen's theorem (connected case), Mathlib `SimpleGraph` form

- Source theorems: J. Petersen, *Die Theorie der regulären graphs*, Acta Math. 15 (1891), 193-220: every bridgeless cubic graph has a perfect matching. T. Schönberger, *Ein Beweis des Petersenschen Graphensatzes*, Acta Litt. Sci. Szeged 7 (1934), 51-57: in a bridgeless cubic graph every edge lies in a perfect matching (equivalently: for any edge there is also a perfect matching avoiding it; the special case of Plesník 1972 with one deleted edge). The Schönberger reference was confirmed in this form by a web search on 2026-10-02 (it is cited so in the current literature on perfect matchings of cubic graphs); the Petersen reference is the standard one (e.g. Wikipedia, 'Petersen's theorem').
- Formal source: `bundle/Star6Simple.lean` (sha256 `37fabd0f3cc1c26effe55b87e6d6574bd4e204951623754b2ba0be64703c1b04`), module `Star6Simple` of the star6 library; star6 artifact `openmath/star6_artifact/lean/pack5/src/Star6Simple.lean` (server `~/danus-projects/star6/lean433/pack5/src/`). Environment: Lean 4.33.1, Mathlib v4.33.1 (commit `0df444a360ea`). NOT a formal-conjectures statement.
- Claimed theorems: `Star6.simple_schoenberger`, `Star6.simple_petersen_connected` (one family).
- Exact Lean statements (context `{V : Type} [Fintype V] [DecidableEq V] (G : SimpleGraph V) [DecidableRel G.Adj]`):
```lean
def Star6.Bridgeless (G : SimpleGraph V) : Prop := ∀ e ∈ G.edgeSet, ¬ G.IsBridge e
theorem Star6.simple_schoenberger (hconn : G.Connected) (hreg : G.IsRegularOfDegree 3) (hbr : Bridgeless G)
    {e : Sym2 V} (he : e ∈ G.edgeSet) :
    (∃ M : G.Subgraph, M.IsPerfectMatching ∧ e ∈ M.edgeSet) ∧ (∃ M : G.Subgraph, M.IsPerfectMatching ∧ e ∉ M.edgeSet)
theorem Star6.simple_petersen_connected (hconn : G.Connected) (hreg : G.IsRegularOfDegree 3) (hbr : Bridgeless G) :
    ∃ M : G.Subgraph, M.IsPerfectMatching
```
- How it is proved: derived from Mathlib's Tutte theorem `SimpleGraph.tutte` (`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Tutte.lean`). The library proves the multigraph version `RH2P.schoenberger` (pack3 module `MhFact_046773df0a672922`, 550 lines): for an edge h = uw form the simple graph GT on the remaining vertices; if GT had a Tutte violator U, every odd component of GT - U sends an odd number of edges to S = U ∪ {u, w} (degree sum), not exactly one (bridgeless), hence at least three; counting the edges leaving S (h lies inside S) bounds the number of odd components by |U|, so there is no violator; `SimpleGraph.tutte` gives a perfect matching of GT, and h plus one edge per matched pair is the matching through h. The avoiding matching is obtained by applying this to another edge at an end of h. `Star6Corollaries.plain_schoenberger` restates it for a multigraph given by `en : E → Sym2 V`; `Star6Simple.lean` (115 lines of private lemmas) translates `SimpleGraph.Connected`, `IsRegularOfDegree 3`, `IsBridge` and `Subgraph.IsPerfectMatching` to and from that vocabulary. Petersen (connected) is a 5-line corollary.
- Dependencies: `Star6Simple` imports `Star6Corollaries` and through it 99 further library modules (54401 lines in total; exact list in `bundle/STAR6_DEPENDENCY.md`). The mathematics of this family is in the 19-module prefix ending with `MhFact_046773df0a672922` (12511 lines) plus the translation layers; the rest of the chain (the star-edge-colouring development) is imported but not used for these two theorems.
- Prior formal libraries searched (2026-10-02, see section 7): **NEW** -- no Lean proof found: Mathlib v4.33.1 (Mathlib/, Archive/, Counterexamples/) has `SimpleGraph.tutte` and `IsBridge` but no hit for petersen/schoenberger/bridgeless-matching; mathlib4 PR/issue search 'Petersen theorem perfect matching', 'bridgeless cubic perfect matching', 'Schönberger': 0 hits; KunalRelia/VCCBG states it as `public axiom PetersenMatching` ('Petersen 1891 (not yet in Mathlib)'); KokunoYumeto/lean-theorems-1 `petersen_bridgeless_cubic_1factor` takes Tutte's condition as a hypothesis `h_tutte` and is therefore not a proof of Petersen's theorem; Vilin97/lean-pool, plby/lean-proofs, formal-conjectures (Wikipedia/LovaszPlummerConjecture.lean only uses `IsBridgeless` in a conjecture), all 4155 JSP PR heads: no hit.
- Genuinely new formal contribution: first formal proof found (Lean ecosystem searched as described in section 7; a web search found no formalization in another proof assistant either) of Schönberger's theorem, and of Petersen's theorem for connected graphs, stated for Mathlib's `SimpleGraph` with Mathlib's own `IsBridge`, `IsRegularOfDegree`, `Subgraph.IsPerfectMatching`. Not a re-export of a Mathlib result: Mathlib has Tutte's theorem (the input) but no theorem producing a perfect matching from regularity and bridgelessness.
- Statement-correspondence / honesty notes: (1) **connected case only** -- Petersen's theorem is usually stated without connectedness (apply the connected case to each component); the union over components is not formalized, so the claim must say 'connected'. (2) `[Fintype V]` finite graphs; `IsRegularOfDegree 3` is cubic; `Bridgeless` is the plain 'no edge is a bridge' with Mathlib's `IsBridge`. Nothing is vacuous: a 3-regular graph has edges, and the hypotheses are satisfiable (e.g. K4). (3) The simple-graph theorems are corollaries of a multigraph theorem; for simple graphs parallel edges do not occur, so the multigraph generality is not visible in the claimed statements. (4) The theorems are by-products of the star6 (DMS conjecture) library that the team submits separately; **the same Lean library is thus cited in two packets** -- operator to confirm that this is acceptable (TODO list). (5) Event-window delta (handbook: only work contributed within the window counts; the window opened 2026-09-27 noon EDT): on the project server the Schönberger module `MhFact_046773df0a672922` is dated 2026-09-29 (fact store `fact_graph/facts/046773df0a672922.md`, `lean/MhFact_046773df0a672922.lean`; Lean 4.20 original), its Lean 4.33.1 port 2026-10-01, `Star6Corollaries.lean` / `Star6Simple.lean` 2026-10-02. These are file timestamps read by the helper, not a signed baseline; the operator must confirm them against the baseline declaration of the star6 submission.
- Axioms: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` for both theorems (`pack5/logs/Star6Simple.out`, and re-compiled independently by this helper against the existing pack3/pack5 oleans: `bundle/Star6Simple.out`, rc=0). No `sorry`, `axiom`, `native_decide` in `Star6Simple.lean`.
- Significance tier: Substantive -- the highest-level item of this packet (two named classical theorems of graph theory absent from Mathlib, about 550 lines for the multigraph theorem on top of Tutte's theorem, plus the translation layers).

### 1.2. Family E942 -- Erdos problem 942

- FC file + commit: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/942.lean` @ `df3f12d7bd06feb3f71ae37abae0ca7cb798d9b1`; informal: https://www.erdosproblems.com/942
- Bundle file: `bundle/Erdos942.lean` (sha256 `e902e8e237372f54a19c554b715ef0435b80cedd1ce68cd5d3064f521a3a1d77`), produced by session `adv3`
- Claimed theorems: `Erdos942.erdos_942.variants.limsup`
- Source theorem / citation: erdosproblems.com/942 (FC docstring: 'It is not hard to prove that limsup h(n) = infinity'), where h(n) is the number of powerful integers in [n^2, (n+1)^2). Standard argument: the powerful numbers a^2 p^3 (p prime) plus simultaneous Diophantine approximation.
- Statements (verbatim from FC, whitespace-normalised):
```lean
@[category textbook, AMS 11] theorem erdos_942.variants.limsup : atTop.limsup (((fun (n : ℕ) ↦ (n : ℕ∞)) ∘ erdos_942.h)) = ⊤
```
- Prior formal libraries searched (2026-10-02, see section 7): 
  - `erdos_942.variants.limsup`: **NEW** -- no complete proof found. kavanaghpatrick/aristotle-math-problems (commit 2425339, 2026-06-24) has two automated attempts (`submissions/yolo_results/yolo_d6_e942_limsup_extracted/...` and `.../yolo_mega6_e942_kronecker_extracted/...`, the latter also under `submissions/nu4_final/`) that prove the bookkeeping and leave the simultaneous-approximation lemma (`kronecker_construction` / `simultaneous_approx_primes`) as `sorry`; JSP PR #4355 states 'no complete formalization known' (#3575 is a filler file, #889 only two powerful numbers); conjectures-io erdos-942: 0 contributions; lean-genius / Bench / other copies: stubs; plby: no file
- Genuinely new formal contribution: First complete formal proof found. Two earlier public attempts by an automated prover (kavanaghpatrick/aristotle-math-problems) reduce the theorem to a simultaneous-approximation lemma and leave exactly that lemma as `sorry` ('requires Kronecker's theorem ... not available in Mathlib'). The proof here closes the gap without Kronecker's theorem and without any linear-independence input: homogeneous simultaneous Dirichlet approximation on the torus (R/Z)^k, obtained from Mathlib's `NormedAddCommGroup.exists_norm_nsmul_le` (measure pigeonhole on a compact group), gives arbitrarily large q with every q / p_i^(3/2) within epsilon of a positive integer a_i; then every a_i^2 p_i^3 lies in [(q-1)^2, (q+1)^2), and of 2M such numbers M lie in one of the two adjacent intervals [(q-1)^2, q^2), [q^2, (q+1)^2). Distinctness of the numbers a_i^2 p_i^3 is by parity of the p_i-adic valuation.
- Statement-correspondence note: The statement is `atTop.limsup (fun n => (h n : ℕ∞)) = ⊤`; the proof shows: for all M, N there is n >= N with h(n) >= M, which is what the limsup in ℕ∞ expresses (no junk value). FC's `Powerful` (= `Nat.Powerful`) also holds for 0 and 1; the witnesses are numbers a^2 p^3 with a > 0, so this plays no role. One added line `open MeasureTheory` (the script's semantic statement check -- restating the FC statement at the end of the file and comparing types by `rfl` -- passed). FC category is `textbook`.
- Axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] for every claimed theorem. FC categories: textbook.
- Proof summary (written by the proving model in `work/adv3/Erdos942.proof.md`; read but not re-derived line by line by the helper):

  > # Problem 942, limsup variant — proof
  > 
  > For any requested count `M`, choose `2M` distinct primes `pᵢ`. Each number `aᵢ² pᵢ³` is powerful; the numbers for different primes are distinct, since the exponent of `pᵢ` has odd parity for its own representation and even parity for another prime's representation.
  > 
  > Use simultaneous Dirichlet approximation on the finite product of unit circles to find an arbitrarily large natural number `q` for which every `q / pᵢ^(3/2)` is very close to an integer `aᵢ`. Then each `aᵢ² pᵢ³` has square root within `1/2` of `q`, so it lies in either `[(q-1)²,q²)` or `[q²,(q+1)²)`. One interval contains at least `M` of the `2M` numbers. The first interval has index `q-1`, and the second has index `q`, both arbitrarily large. Thus `h(n) ≥ M` frequently, giving `limsup h(n)=⊤` in `ℕ∞`.
  > 
  > The approximation needs no linear independence: homogeneous approximation to zero suffices because both adjacent square intervals are allowed. The finite product of circles is compact, and Mathlib's `NormedAddCommGroup.exists_norm_nsmul_le` supplies simultaneous Dirichlet approximation. Multiplying an approximate return by a fixed natural number makes its index arbitrarily large while retaining a suitably chosen error bound.
  > 
  > Source: the Formal Conjectures docstring for Problem 942, which states the limsup result. The approximation step uses Mathlib's `NormedAddCommGroup.exists_norm_nsmul_le`; the two-sided construction is worked out here. The problem reference is [erdosproblems.com/942](https://www.erdosproblems.com/942).
  > 
  > Formal statement quirks: the limsup takes values in `ℕ∞`, so its top value represents unbounded counts. The FC definition of `Powerful` also includes zero, which affects only the initial interval and does not affect the limsup. The file's main conjecture has `answer(sorry)` but is outside this target and is left unchanged.

- Significance tier: Substantive: the strongest Erdos item of the batch (about 230 added lines, real analysis on the torus; earlier automated attempts stalled on exactly this step).

### 1.3. Family E44 -- Erdos problem 44

- FC file + commit: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/44.lean` @ `df3f12d7bd06feb3f71ae37abae0ca7cb798d9b1`; informal: https://www.erdosproblems.com/44
- Bundle file: `bundle/Erdos44.lean` (sha256 `2a1d49488e57fddd11d99bea84730545868ec84aa32407ce5f54f786696408a5`), produced by session `gptG`
- Claimed theorems: `Erdos44.greedy_sidon_construction`
- Source theorem / citation: Greedy Sidon set: for every N >= 1 there is a Sidon set A in {1..N} with |A| >= N^(1/3) (folklore, usually attributed to Erdos; FC cites the survey arXiv:2103.15850, Section 1).
- Statements (verbatim from FC, whitespace-normalised):
```lean
@[category textbook, AMS 5 11] theorem greedy_sidon_construction (N : ℕ) (hN : 1 ≤ N) : ∃ᵉ (A ⊆ Finset.Icc 1 N), IsSidon (A : Set ℕ) ∧ N ≤ A.card ^ 3
```
- Prior formal libraries searched (2026-10-02, see section 7): 
  - `greedy_sidon_construction`: **NEW** -- no proof found; conjectures-io erdos-44 proves only maxSidonSubsetCard_icc_bound; lean-genius Erdos44Problem has no greedy N^(1/3) bound; kavanaghpatrick/aristotle-math-problems and FormalConjectures-Bench copies are `sorry` stubs (of an older, false sqrt(N) version of the statement)
- Genuinely new formal contribution: First formal proof found of the greedy N <= |A|^3 bound in the FC statement. An auxiliary lemma builds the greedy set by recursion on N and shows every x in [1,N] is of the form b+c-a with a,b,c in A, whence N <= |A|^3.
- Statement-correspondence note: Statement is exactly the intended bound, written as `N <= A.card ^ 3` (no real cube roots). No junk values: A is a Finset inside `Finset.Icc 1 N`. Note the FC statement was corrected upstream before the pinned commit (older FC versions claimed the false bound `A.card >= N.sqrt`; public stub copies still carry that).
- Axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] for every claimed theorem. FC categories: textbook.
- Proof summary (written by the proving model in `work/gptG/Erdos44.proof.md`; read but not re-derived line by line by the helper):

  > # Erdős 44: greedy Sidon construction
  > 
  > Process the integers from 1 through N. Keep an integer if adjoining it to the selected set preserves the Sidon property. The selected set A is Sidon and lies in [1,N]. Every integer x in [1,N] has a representation x+a=b+c with a,b,c in A: if x was kept, use a=b=c=x. If x was skipped, the failure of the Sidon condition for the enlarged set supplies such a relation. The other possible failure, 2x=a+b with a,b already selected, is impossible because a,b<x.
  > 
  > The map (a,b,c) ↦ b+c-a sends A³ onto a set containing [1,N]. Hence N ≤ |A³|=|A|³.
  > 
  > Source: Section 1 of [arXiv:2103.15850](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15850), as cited in the Formal Conjectures docstring; the greedy counting argument is formalized directly. The statement uses natural subtraction in the counting map, with the representation equation ensuring it gives the intended x.

- Significance tier: Substantive (textbook-level counting argument, ~80 added lines).

### 1.4. Family E123 -- Erdos problem 123

- FC file + commit: `FormalConjectures/ErdosProblems/123.lean` @ `df3f12d7bd06feb3f71ae37abae0ca7cb798d9b1`; informal: https://www.erdosproblems.com/123

- Claimed theorems: `Erdos123.erdos_123.variants.powers_2_3`
- Source theorem / citation: {2^k 3^l} is d-complete: every (large) integer is a sum of distinct numbers 2^k 3^l none dividing another. Conjectured by Erdos 1992 [Er92b]; proved by Jansen and others by the induction quoted in the FC docstring (erdosproblems.com/123).
- Statements (verbatim from FC, whitespace-normalised):
```lean
@[category research solved, AMS 11] theorem erdos_123.variants.powers_2_3 : IsDComplete (↑(powers 2) * ↑(powers 3))
```
- Prior formal libraries searched (2026-10-02, see section 7): 
  - `erdos_123.variants.powers_2_3`: **NEW** -- plby Erdos123.lean and JSP PR #715 treat the three-generator theorem / the 6,10,15 counterexample, not the two-generator set; lean-genius Erdos123Problem derives it from an `axiom powers23_repr` (not a proof); FC upstream PRs #2485/#3344 only retag the category (sorryAx present)
- Genuinely new formal contribution: First formal proof found of the two-generator d-completeness statement. Strong induction exactly as in the docstring (double the representation of n/2; for odd n subtract the largest power of 3), with the antichain condition checked.
- Statement-correspondence note: `IsDComplete` asks for representations eventually; the proof gives them for every n (n = 0 by the empty sum), so nothing degenerate is used. `powers 2 * powers 3` is the pointwise product set {2^k 3^l}.
- Axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound] for every claimed theorem. FC categories: research solved.
- Proof summary (written by the proving model in `work/gptF/Erdos123.proof.md`; read but not re-derived line by line by the helper):

  > Source: the inductive argument in the docstring of `erdos_123.variants.powers_2_3` in Formal Conjectures, citing Erdős's 1992 formulation.
  > 
  > Prove by strong induction that every natural number has a sum representation by a finite divisibility antichain of numbers `2^a 3^b`. Zero uses the empty set. For a positive even number, double every summand in a representation of its half. For an odd number `n`, let `q = 3^⌊log₃ n⌋`. Then `q ≤ n < 3q`, so `n-q=2m` with `m<q`. Double a representation of `m` and add `q`. Its doubled summands are less than `2q`. None divides `q`, since they are even and `q` is odd. If `q` divided a doubled summand `2x`, coprimality of `q` and `2` would give `q∣x`, contradicting `x≤m<q`. The formal statement asks for representations eventually; the proof gives them for every `n`.
  > 
  > The source file contains unrelated theorems with `sorry`; the axiom print for this target contains only `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`.

For the induced variant `eq_aleph_0.parts.i` the FC formalisation note says the edgeless argument 'does not carry over'; our proof uses a different (pigeonhole) argument, so this variant is slightly more than the source asserts. `chromaticCardinal` is an sInf over cardinals; the proof exhibits explicit colourings, no junk value of sInf is used.

  > # Erdős 918: all-subgraph equality variants
  > 
  > For any graph whose vertex set has at least `κ` elements, choose a subset `W` of cardinality `κ`. Give `W` the edgeless subgraph structure. Its chromatic cardinal is at most one, so it cannot equal `ℵ₀`. This contradicts the demand that *every* subgraph with `κ` vertices have chromatic cardinal exactly `ℵ₀`. Apply this with `(κ, #V) = (ℵ₁, ℵ₂)` and `(ℵ_ω, ℵ_(ω+1))`.
  > 
  > Source: the FC docstring for [Erdős problem 918](https://www.erdosproblems.com/918) notes this edgeless-subgraph obstruction. The argument applies to the all-subgraphs variants because they quantify over non-induced subgraphs.
  > 
  > For the induced-subgraph variant at `ℵ₁`, first choose any `ℵ₁`-sized vertex subset `W`. Its stipulated chromatic cardinal `ℵ₀` is attained by a coloring with countably many colors. Since `ℵ₁` is uncountable and a countable union of countable sets is countable, one color class is uncountable. As a subset of `W`, it has cardinality exactly `ℵ₁`; its induced graph is edgeless and has chromatic cardinal at most one, contradicting the stipulation. This argument uses the regularity of `ℵ₁` and does not establish the analogous `ℵ_ω` variant.

  > 
  > Suppose the largest denominator is `n=p^k`, where `p` is prime and `k>0`. Every other denominator `s` is smaller than `p^k`, so `p^k` does not divide `s`. Consequently the `p`-adic valuation of `1/s` is strictly greater than the valuation `-k` of `1/n`. The valuation of the sum over the other denominators is likewise greater than `-k`, using the finite-sum valuation lemma and positivity. The valuation of the full sum must therefore be `-k`, whereas its stated value `1` has valuation zero, a contradiction. The proof first rules out the singleton representation so the finite-sum lemma applies.

This yields the first real inequality. For the second, `2j ≤ n` gives `2(j-k) ≤ n-k` for every `k`; induction on `i` proves `2^i` times the descending factorial of `j` is at most that of `n`.

The new numerator is a q - b, which lies in [0,a), so this terminates by induction on a. The next chosen denominator is strictly larger than q. In the initial application, q is past the consecutive block. Combining the two finite sets gives distinct denominators, all above the requested bound, with reciprocal sum 1. Sort the finite set to obtain the strictly increasing Fin-indexed sequence.

Complementation is an injection on all subsets of `Fin n`; hence the family has at most half of the `2^n` subsets. Conversely, all subsets containing one fixed element form an intersecting family of size `2^(n-1)`. The proof separately establishes that the set of candidate cardinalities is bounded above before using `le_csSup`, avoiding the junk value of an unbounded natural `sSup`.

The integer set {0,136,200,243,246,249,272,286,298,323,400,528,596,1056} is checked by `decide` to satisfy the (4,5) condition and to have no Sidon subset of size 9 (every 9-subset contains one of 12 listed 3-term APs); it is transported to R; hence every admissible c satisfies 14 c <= 8.
- Statement-correspondence note: Is using Ma-Tang fine for the fixed statement? Yes: the statement only asserts sup < 3/5 and 4/7 < 3/5; any valid proof suffices, and the strict inequality is in fact not obviously delivered by the cited non-strict Gyarfas-Lehel bound. The set {c | IsAdmissible c} is nonempty (c <= 0) and bounded above, and the proof bounds every admissible c, so no junk value of `sSup` is used; `Set.ncard` is only applied to finite sets.

  > Lean checks by `decide` that each four-element subset has at least 11 differences. It also checks that every nine-element subset contains one of twelve listed three-term arithmetic progressions. Each such progression violates the Sidon property, so every Sidon subset of `A` has at most eight elements. The integer set and its difference set are mapped injectively to real numbers. Thus any admissible `c` satisfies `14c ≤ 8`, giving `sSup {c | IsAdmissible c} ≤ 4/7 < 3/5`.

  > For a balanced partition \(A\sqcup B=\{1,\ldots,2n\}\), there are \(n^2\) ordered cross pairs. Each pair contributes to exactly one difference \(a-b\), and all such differences lie in \([-2n,2n)\), an interval of \(4n\) integers. Each difference has at most \(\operatorname{MaxOverlap}(A,B)\) contributing pairs, so \(n^2\le4n\operatorname{MaxOverlap}(A,B)\). Taking the minimum gives \(n\le4M(n)\), hence \(M(n)/n\ge1/4\) for positive \(n\). The eventual inequality implies the liminf bound.
  > 
  > The formal proof also shows that the set defining `M` is nonempty, so its natural-number `sInf` is a genuine minimum. It verifies `M(n)/n ≤ 1`, the boundedness needed by Mathlib's real `liminf` lemma. No `answer(...)` term or cast in the target statement needed replacement.

- Genuinely new formal contribution: Proofs of the two FC statements in terms of `Nat.maxPrimeFac`. tong: Dirichlet's theorem (`Nat.infinite_setOfPred_prime_and_eq_mod`) gives infinitely many primes q ≡ -1 (mod 8·p!); by quadratic reciprocity and the supplementary law for 2 every prime r <= p is a square mod q, hence so is n; but -1 is not a square mod q (q ≡ 3 mod 4), so q does not divide n+1. sampaio: n+1 = 2^k, 19 | 2^k - 1 forces 18 | k, then 73 | 2^18 - 1 | n.

  > # Erdős 649, Tong variant
  > 
  > Choose primes `q ≡ -1 (mod 8 p!)` by Dirichlet's theorem. These form an infinite set. In particular `q ≡ 7 (mod 8)` and, for each prime `r ≤ p`, `q ≡ -1 (mod r)`.
  > 
  > Every prime `r ≤ p` is a quadratic residue modulo `q`: for `r = 2` use the supplementary law for 2. For odd `r`, quadratic reciprocity and `q ≡ -1 (mod r)` give the result in either case `r ≡ 1` or `3 (mod 4)`. The prime factors of any `n` with `P(n)=p` all lie below `p`, hence `n` is a square modulo `q`. But `q ≡ 3 (mod 4)`, so `-1` is not a square modulo `q`. Thus `q ∤ n+1`, while `P(n+1)=q` would imply `q ∣ n+1`.

  > Source: Alan Tong's argument in the Formal Conjectures docstring for [Erdős Problem 649](https://www.erdosproblems.com/649), using Mathlib's Dirichlet theorem and quadratic reciprocity. The `maxPrimeFac` statement requires excluding the junk values `n ≤ 1`; this follows from `P(n)=p` with `p` prime.

No proof of the FC statement itself found (all public copies are `sorry` stubs; no JSP PR)
- Genuinely new formal contribution: Proof of the exact FC statement `χ(ℝ²) ≤ 7` for FC's `UnitDistancePlaneGraph Set.univ`: triangular lattice of centres ((4/5)(i + j/2), (2√3/5) j), colour (i + 5j) mod 7; every point of the plane is at distance < 1/2 from some centre (squared distance <= 16/75, proved in oblique coordinates with floors); two distinct centres of the same colour are at distance > 2 because i^2 + ij + j^2 is a positive multiple of 7; so two points of the same colour are at distance < 1 or > 1. The file also proves `4 ≤ χ(ℝ²)` with an explicit Moser spindle (seven points with coordinates in Q(√3, √11), eleven unit distances checked by `nlinarith`, the 3-colour contradiction by two 'diamond' lemmas).
- Statement-correspondence note: Both proofs are the real theorems, not artefacts: FC's graph has as vertices the subtype of `Set.univ` in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 2)`, adjacency `dist x y = 1`, and `chromaticNumber` is ℕ∞-valued; the upper bound exhibits a total colouring of the whole plane by `ZMod 7` (the nearby centre is picked by `Classical.choose`), the lower bound exhibits a genuine unit-distance configuration with exact real coordinates. PRIOR ART: Vilin97/lean-pool `HadwigerNelsonBounds` proves 5 <= χ <= 7 (same Isbell construction, own graph definition), and JSP PR #270 proves `4 ≤ χ(ℝ²)` in the exact FC shape; so only the FC-statement form of the upper bound is new.

  > # Erdős 508: the four and seven colour bounds
  > 
  > Sources: the [FC docstring](https://www.erdosproblems.com/508) cites the Moser spindle for the lower bound and Isbell's hexagonal tiling for the upper bound. The seven-colour hexagon pattern is also described in [The Chromatic Number of the Plane](https://opentext.uleth.ca/Ramsey/sec_Chromatic.html).
  > 
  > For the lower bound, a diamond is two equilateral triangles sharing an edge. In any three-colouring its opposite tips have the same colour: each tip must take the third colour excluded by the shared edge. Construct two diamonds sharing one tip, rotating one so that their other tips are a unit distance apart. This makes a three-colouring impossible. The coordinates use square roots of 3 and 11; the Lean proof checks the eleven required unit edges algebraically and checks the finite three-colour argument with `decide`.
  > 
  > For the upper bound, use the triangular lattice with centres
  > `((4/5)(i+j/2), (2√3/5)j)` for integers `i,j`, and colour centre `(i,j)` by `i+5j` modulo 7. Every point lies within distance **strictly less than 1/2** of a centre: write it in oblique lattice coordinates, take the floors of both coordinates, and check the four corners of that unit cell. The squared distance to the nearest corner is at most `16/75`, using the fact that in either triangular half of the cell one of its three vertices has quadratic distance `a²+ab+b² ≤ 1/3`. Distinct centres of the same colour have integer displacement satisfying `i+5j ≡ 0 (mod 7)`. Its positive quadratic norm `i²+ij+j²` is a multiple of 7, hence at least 7. The centres are therefore more than distance 2 apart. Give each plane point the colour of a nearby centre. Two points receiving the same colour are either less than distance 1 apart (same centre) or more than distance 1 apart (different centres). This is the Voronoi form of the hexagonal tiling construction.
  > 
  > The FC statement uses the chromatic number of the graph on the subtype `Set.univ`, valued in `ℕ∞`. The auxiliary colouring uses `ZMod 7`, whose cardinality is 7. The other `sorry` declarations in the copied FC file are untouched.

- Formal source: `bundle/Erdos<n>.lean` (one file per claimed family), `bundle/SHA256SUMS`, `VERIFY.md`; optional families in `bundle_optional/`. G-PM: `bundle/Star6Simple.lean` + `bundle/STAR6_DEPENDENCY.md` (exact list of the star6 modules it imports) + `bundle/Star6Simple.out`; the library itself is in the star6 artifact and is not duplicated here.
- Environment: Lean `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`; Mathlib as pinned by formal-conjectures at `df3f12d7bd06feb3f71ae37abae0ca7cb798d9b1`.
- Reproduction: `git checkout df3f12d7bd06feb3f71ae37abae0ca7cb798d9b1` in formal-conjectures, `lake exe cache get`, `lake env lean bundle/Erdos<n>.lean`; expected output lines are listed in `VERIFY.md`.
- Statement correspondence (mechanical): for every target the text from the attribute line through `:=` is compared (comments stripped, whitespace-normalised) with the pinned FC file, and a whole-file diff confirms that the only removed FC lines are the `sorry` proofs of the targets. Added lines are private auxiliary declarations plus, in some files, `open`/`set_option`/local `instance` lines (listed in `VERIFIED.tsv` flags). Per-family notes on what the statement really says are given below.
- Axioms / trust: every target prints `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. No `native_decide`, `axiom`, `unsafe`, `implemented_by`, `admit`. Other, untouched statements of the same FC files still contain `sorry`; they are not claimed and no target depends on them.
- `answer(...)`: no target contains `answer(sorry)`; `answer(True)` / `answer(False)` terms were fixed by FC and are unchanged.

## 7. Provenance (handbook 8.3)

- Baseline: formal-conjectures at `df3f12d7bd06feb3f71ae37abae0ca7cb798d9b1` (statements and definitions; not our work) and Mathlib. Event delta: the proofs and auxiliary lemmas, all produced on 2026-10-02 inside the event window (session directories `~/erdos-fc/work/<session>/` with prompts and `codex_*.log`).
- AI / tool disclosure: proofs written by OpenAI GPT `gpt-6-sol` via `codex exec` (unattended); Lean 4 via `lake env lean`; verification (`verify_all.py`), prior-art search (`prior_art.py`, `final/jsp_scan*.py`, `final/gh_check.py`) and packet by Claude (Anthropic). Compute: one team server. Model versions / credits: **TODO(operator)**.
- Human checking statement: **TODO(operator)**. At the time of writing no human has read the proofs or this packet.
- Outside help / conflicts: none known to the helper; **TODO(operator)** confirm.
- Prior-art search performed 2026-10-02 (what was searched):
  1. `TheJustinSunPrize/awards`: main at `5125fd7` plus the head of **every one of its 4155 pull requests** (fetched to a local clone); all non-catalog files grepped for the problem numbers, FC theorem names and statement vocabulary.
  2. `plby/lean-proofs` at `8822f7d` (2026-09-15, still HEAD on 2026-10-02): all trees (`src/latest`, `src/v4.*`, `ErdosProblems/`), by file name, theorem name and number.
  3. formal-conjectures `main` (raw files fetched 2026-10-02): no target carries a `formal_proof` tag or a proof; upstream PRs titled 'solve(...)' for these problems (e.g. #2485, #3344, #2591, #3115, #2696, #3218; all closed 2026-03-03) only retag the category and leave `sorryAx`.
  4. GitHub code search (2026-10-02) for each target theorem name and key definition names; every hit file was downloaded and the target declaration tested for a non-`sorry` body (`final/gh_check.tsv`, 328 files). Repositories inspected include AllenGrahamHart/FormalConjectures-Bench (77 gold tasks checked; the others are unsolved task stubs), kavanaghpatrick/aristotle-math-problems, conjectures-io/conjectures-contribution, williamjblair/lean-proofs, rjwalters/lean-genius, Paul-Lez/fc100, epoch-research/LeanOpenProblems, hongjin-he/erdos-lean, pcycho/erdos1063-cambie, tadamcz/fc-review-results.
  5. Mathlib (pinned): name/keyword grep, done by the earlier helper.
  6. **v2 pass (helper-m2-advanced, 2026-10-02 14:20-15:00 UTC)** for E508, E138, E942, E649, E770, E273, E1136-mueller, E617 and for Petersen/Schoenberger: (i) all 4155 JSP PR heads re-scanned with new number and keyword patterns (`final/jsp_scan3.py`, `jsp_scan4.py`; outputs `jsp_scan3.json/.out`, `jsp_scan4.json/.out`) and every hit file opened; (ii) plby (all trees), `prior/*` clones (FormalConjectures-Bench incl. `oracles/`, conjectures-io, aristotle-math-problems, lean-genius excerpts), pinned Mathlib `Mathlib/`, `Archive/`, `Counterexamples/` grepped by name and vocabulary; (iii) formal-conjectures `main` re-fetched: still at the pinned commit `df3f12d` (2026-10-01), no `formal_proof` tag on any target; (iv) GitHub code search for the nine exact theorem names (incl. E617 `r_eq_3`) (`final/ghsearch_adv.txt`, 194 hit files downloaded and tested by `final/gh_check_adv.py` -> `gh_check_adv.tsv`: no proved copy except the two Aristotle E942 files, whose main theorem rests on a `sorry` lemma) and generic searches ('Hadwiger Nelson', 'Moser spindle', 'Petersen bridgeless IsPerfectMatching', 'bridgeless cubic perfect matching', 'Schönberger', lean-pool-scoped searches), which found Vilin97/lean-pool `HadwigerNelsonBounds`, KunalRelia/VCCBG and (via web search) KokunoYumeto/lean-theorems-1; (v) mathlib4 PR and issue search for Petersen / Schoenberger: no hits; (vi) web search for a formalization of Petersen's theorem in any proof assistant: none found (only the Lean Tutte-theorem paper arXiv:2504.18146).
     External proofs were read, not compiled by us; the four JSP submissions (#270, #516, #580, #299) carry their own `verification.txt` with `#print axioms` lines `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, and the Bench oracle file has no `sorry`.
  7. v1 error found in this pass: the plby file for problem 649 contains `sampaio_counterexample` and `tong_counterexamples`; v1 had classified `erdos_649.variants.sampaio` as NEW. The other v1 'NEW' verdicts were spot-checked again against the plby theorem lists (E123, E292, E395, E698, E703, E748: plby proves only the main theorems; E44, E295, E918, E939: no plby file) but were not otherwise re-audited.
  Limits: private repositories, Zulip, and the erdosproblems.com forum attachments were not searched; GitHub code search is not exhaustive. 'NEW' means 'no prior formal proof found by the above', nothing stronger.
- Reproducibility limitations: none known; each Erdos file compiles standalone in about a minute (E757 a few minutes, kernel `decide` over 1001 four-subsets). `Star6Simple.lean` needs the star6 library (see `STAR6_DEPENDENCY.md`); that library is so far only in local, unpublished repositories.

## 8. Publication authority (handbook 8.4)

- Attribution approval and permission to release under the competition terms: **TODO(operator)**. formal-conjectures is Apache-2.0; bundle files are derived from it and keep its header.

## 9. Operator TODO list

- [ ] Autolab owner / workspace, submission ID(s), Hill hash/version and Climb link (if the competition Hill applies to M2), final commit, evaluator report.
- [ ] Roster, entrant class, affiliations, resource classification; each human's contribution.
- [ ] Human checking statement (currently: none). Recommended minimum: one human reads the section 1 statements + correspondence notes and re-runs VERIFY.md on a clean checkout.
- [ ] Decide: include the section 2 minor list or not; claim the section 3 optional families (with disclosure) or not.
- [ ] G-PM: confirm that citing the star6 library in this M2 packet is compatible with the separate star6 submission (same Lean artifact used in two packets); publish or attach the star6 artifact so that `Star6Simple.lean` can be rebuilt by reviewers (it needs the 100 modules of `STAR6_DEPENDENCY.md`); keep the wording 'connected case' for Petersen; confirm that the Schönberger module (dated 2026-09-29 on the server) is event-window work relative to the declared star6 baseline.
- [ ] E649: v1 of this packet (and any text derived from it) called `erdos_649.variants.sampaio` a new formalization; that is wrong (plby). Remove E649 from any substantive list already circulated.
- [ ] The local repository `openmath/erdos_m2_artifact/` has no remote; decide whether and where to publish it (operator action only).
- [ ] Decide whether E939 r = 7 should be claimed given its degenerate witness (summand 1); r = 8 alone still carries the family.
- [ ] Model version / compute / credit disclosure; outside help and conflicts statement.
- [ ] Publication authority: attribution approval and release permission under the competition terms.
- [ ] If M2 targets must be registered/admitted as families before scoring (handbook 3.1, 4.1), register E<n> ids with the organisers.
