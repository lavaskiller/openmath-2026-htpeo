* **Human review:** the team reports that the claimed statements and the statement-correspondence notes of this packet were reviewed by a human team member. Reviewer(s): ____________ ; scope: ____________ ; date: ____________ . Sentences further below that say "human checking: none" describe the state before this review.
* **Public repository:** https://github.com/lavaskiller/openmath-2026-htpeo — this entry is the folder `entries/dms-star6`; the submitted state is fixed by the git tag `dms-v1` (https://github.com/lavaskiller/openmath-2026-htpeo/tree/dms-v1/entries/dms-star6). The commit hashes quoted further below refer to the earlier local artifact repository with the same file contents (checked by `SHA256SUMS`).
* **Publication authority:** the team has made the materials public at the URL above. Attribution approval by every roster member: ____________ .

Packet version: **final v1 (2026-10-02)**; it replaces the drafts v1–v3 and absorbs the two addenda of
2026-10-02. State: **nothing has been submitted by the writers of this packet; operator TODOs are listed in
section 6.** Structure follows handbook section 8.

**We do not claim that the conjecture is proved.** Every claim below is either an unconditional theorem about
special cases / small orders / an equivalent reformulation, or a theorem of the form "named open hypotheses ⇒
conjecture". Material that is not Lean-checked is in section 3 and is labelled as such.

Every item marked **TODO(operator)** is something the writers of this packet could not determine or are not
entitled to decide.

### 1.1 The formal statement of the conjecture

```lean
def RH2F.DMS : Prop :=
  ∀ (G : MGraph), G.Subcubic → G.Loopless → ∀ (P : Fin G.m → Prop), MGraph.Colourable P 6
```

Every loopless multigraph with maximum degree at most 3, and every sub-multigraph of it (edge set `P`), has a star
edge colouring with 6 colours. With `P = fun _ => True` and `G` simple this is the Open Problem Garden statement.
`Star6.dms_iff_plain : DMS ↔ RH2Fid.DMSP` proves it equivalent to an independently written statement in
Mathlib vocabulary (`en : E → Sym2 V`, `Fintype`), and `BlockStar.dms_iff : RH2F.DMS ↔ ∀ G, DMSfor G` (by
`Iff.rfl`) splits it into its instances. How to read `MGraph`, `Star`, `Colourable`, `Subcubic`, `Loopless`:
section 2.4.

**`RH2F.DMS` is not proved anywhere in the artifact.** It appears only as a hypothesis, as a conclusion of
conditional theorems, and on one side of equivalences.

### 1.2 Tier T1 — unconditional infinite families (special cases of the conjecture)

Lean 4.33.1 + Mathlib v4.33.1, `lean/pack4/` (125 modules). Axioms of every theorem: `[propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound]` (`lean/pack4/axioms.log`). Statements verbatim (`#check` output in `axioms.log`):

```lean
FlowerSnark.flower_star       : ∀ (n : ℕ), n % 2 = 1 → 5 ≤ n → MGraph.Star 5 (FlowerSnark.flowerCol n)
FlowerSnark.flower_family     : ∀ (n : ℕ), n % 2 = 1 → 5 ≤ n → StarFamily (FlowerSnark.flowerSnark n) 5

GPetersen2.gp2_spokes         : ∀ (k : ℕ) (e : Fin (GPetersen2.gp2 k).m), ↑(GPetersen2.gpCol k e) = 5 ↔ ↑e % 3 = 1

GPk.star4                     : ∀ (m : ℕ), MGraph.Star 5 (GPk.pcol GPk.tab4)          -- on gp (10 * m) 4
GPk.family4                   : ∀ (m : ℕ), 1 ≤ m → GPk.StarFam (GPk.gp (10 * m) 4) 5  -- likewise 6, 8, 10, 12, 14
gp_star5  : ∀ (k n : ℕ), 1 ≤ k → k ≤ 15 → 2 * k + 1 ≤ n → ¬(n = 3 ∧ k = 1) →
              ∃ c : Fin (GPk.gp n k).m → Fin 5, MGraph.Star 5 c
gp_family : ∀ (k n : ℕ), 1 ≤ k → k ≤ 15 → 2 * k + 1 ≤ n → ¬(n = 3 ∧ k = 1) → GPk.StarFam (GPk.gp n k) 5
Inflation.inflate_star5 : ∀ (H : MGraph), H.Loopless → ∀ (slot : Fin H.m → Bool → Fin 3),
              Inflation.PortsInj H slot → ∃ c : Fin (Inflation.inflate H slot).m → Fin 5, MGraph.Star 5 c
Mobius.star5                  : ∀ (n : ℕ), 4 ≤ n → MGraph.Star 5 (Mobius.col n)
Mobius.mobius_family          : ∀ (n : ℕ), 4 ≤ n → StarFamily (Mobius.mobius n) 5
```

`StarFamily G k` (= `GPk.StarFam G k`) is
`G.Subcubic ∧ G.Loopless ∧ (∀ P, MGraph.Colourable P k) ∧ (∀ P, MGraph.Colourable P 6)`, and
`starFamily_dms : StarFamily G k → DMSfor G`. So each `…_family` theorem is literally the instance of `RH2F.DMS`
for the graphs of the family — proved with 5 colours instead of 6.

In plain words (graph definitions: `lean/pack4/README.md` §2; novelty: section 2.6):

| | Family | Range | Colours | Literature status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | flower snarks J_n (Isaacs) | every odd n ≥ 5 | 5 | appears new |
| B | Goldberg snarks G_k | every odd k ≥ 5 | 5 | appears new |
| C | GP(k,2), with the spokes as one colour class | every k ≥ 5 | 6 (class 6 = the spokes) | appears new as a perfect-matching-class statement |
| D | GP(n,2), n ≥ 5; GP(n,3), n ≥ 7; GP(10m,4), GP(14m,6), GP(17m,8), GP(22m,10), GP(26m,12), GP(30m,14), m ≥ 1 | all | 5 | contained in E; kept because they formalize the informal facts of the run |
| E | generalized Petersen graphs GP(n,k), **1 ≤ k ≤ 15, every n ≥ 2k+1**, except GP(3,1) (the prism, χ′ₛ = 6) | all | 5 | the Zhu–Shao conjecture for k ≤ 15; **partly new**: new exactly for the (n,k) with gcd(n,k) ≤ 2 not covered in print (section 2.6) |
| F | Petersen-type vertex inflation of **any** loopless multigraph H with an injective port assignment (each vertex replaced by the Petersen graph minus a vertex) | all such H | 5 | appears new (elementary) |
| G | Möbius ladders M_n (2n vertices: the cycle c_0 … c_{2n−1} with the chords c_i c_{i+n}) | every n ≥ 4 | 5 | nothing found in the literature (M_3 = K₃,₃ needs 6) |

Also unconditional, in the Lean-core file `lean/pack2/lean433/StarDMS2.lean`: `P06Lean.cover_main` — star
colourings pull back along locally injective homomorphisms, so every cover of K₃,₃ is star 6-edge-colourable and
every cover of the Petersen graph star 5-edge-colourable. This is a formalization of a **known** argument
(DMS 2013, proof of Thm 5.1(b), arXiv v2 numbering); it is listed for completeness and **not** claimed as an advance.

### 1.3 Tier T2 — unconditional small-order theorems, the equivalence, and the shape of a counterexample

Lean 4.33.1 + Mathlib v4.33.1, `lean/pack5/src/` (4 modules on top of the chain). Axioms: `[propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (`lean/pack5/logs/*.out`). Verbatim (namespace `Star6`; the library's
namespaces `MGraph`, `RH2F` are open, so `DMS` is `RH2F.DMS`):

    (hmin : MinimalCounterexample Q 6) :
    ConnectedOn Q ∧ 8 ≤ G.n ∧ (CubicOn Q → BridgelessOn Q ∧ 16 ≤ vcount Q)
```

In plain words (`InG X P` = "`P` is a connected bridgeless cubic edge set of the loopless multigraph `X`";
`leafSet P g` = the leaf graph T(P, g): delete the edge `g = st`, add a vertex `x` joined to `s` and `t`, and a
pendant edge at `x`):

1. Every bridgeless cubic loopless multigraph with at most **14** vertices is star 6-edge-colourable.
2. In a connected one with 10–14 vertices, every edge lies in a perfect matching that is a colour class of a star
   6-edge-colouring, and is avoided by such a perfect matching.
3. Every leaf graph of a connected bridgeless cubic loopless multigraph with ≤ 14 vertices is star
   6-edge-colourable.
4. DMS holds for all loopless subcubic multigraphs with at most **7** vertices.
5. (`dms_iff_cubic16`) **DMS holds if and only if every connected bridgeless cubic loopless multigraph on at
   least 16 vertices is star 6-edge-colourable and so is each of its leaf graphs.**
6. If DMS fails, a counterexample of that shape exists; a smallest connected bridgeless cubic multigraph that is not
   "EX1-good" is 2-cut-reduced and has ≥ 16 vertices; an edge-minimal counterexample is connected, lives on ≥ 8
   vertices, and if cubic is bridgeless with ≥ 16 vertices.
7. `bounded_reduction`: for every N, the two hypotheses of the chain restricted to order ≤ N give 1–4 for order ≤ N
   (≤ N/2 for general subcubic graphs); the induction never looks at larger graphs.

The same in `Sym2`/`Fintype` vocabulary (`Star6.plain_star6_cubic_bridgeless_le14`, `plain_star6_subcubic_le7`,
`plain_ex1_10_14`, `plain_star6_leaf_le14`) and for Mathlib's `SimpleGraph`:

```lean
theorem Star6.simple_star6_cubic_bridgeless_le14 (hreg : G.IsRegularOfDegree 3) (hbr : Bridgeless G)
    (hn : Fintype.card V ≤ 14) : ∃ c : G.edgeSet → Fin 6, IsStarEdgeColouring G c
theorem Star6.simple_star6_subcubic_le7 (hdeg : ∀ v, G.degree v ≤ 3) (hn : Fintype.card V ≤ 7) :
    ∃ c : G.edgeSet → Fin 6, IsStarEdgeColouring G c
```

Honest limits of T2: the bound for general subcubic graphs is 7, not 14 (the reduction for two vertices of
degree < 3 doubles the graph); "a minimum counterexample is cubic" is **not** proved (the correct statement is
item 5: cubic graphs *and their leaf graphs*); nothing unconditional about colourability at 16 vertices. T2 contains
no mathematics beyond T3/T4: it is the chain's induction run with bounded hypotheses plus vocabulary translations
(`lean/pack5/README.md`, "What is new and what is not").

### 1.4 Tier T3 — the conditional reduction chain, and Tier T4 — finite certificates

Lean 4.33.1 + Mathlib v4.33.1, `lean/pack3/` (98 modules). Top theorem, verbatim (axioms: `[propext,
Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`, `lean/pack3/build/axioms.log`; `Main.lean` re-elaborates the statement):

```lean
theorem RH2F.layer37 :
    BASE12 ∧ SIMPLE14 ∧ B14D ∧ FEEXIST16 ∧ (IID16 → IID) ∧ (FEEXISTD18 → FEEXISTD10) ∧
    (FEEXTTNE16 → FEEXIST0NE16 → IID16) ∧
    (FEEXTD10 → FEEXISTD18 → POLE → TDTRI → IID16 → DMS) ∧
    (FEEXTD10 → FEEXISTD18 → WEXT → TDLTRI → IID16 → DMS) ∧
    (FEEXTD10 → FEEXISTD18 → POLE → TDTRI → FEEXTTNE16 → FEEXIST0NE16 → DMS)
```

**T3 (conditional).** Parts 8–10 are reductions of DMS to named hypotheses (`star6_dms_conditional_A`:
`FEEXTD10 → FEEXISTD18 → POLE → TDTRI → FEEXTTNE16 → FEEXIST0NE16 → DMS`; `star6_dms_conditional_B`:
`FEEXTD10 → FEEXISTD18 → WEXT → TDLTRI → IID16 → DMS`). Each hypothesis is an ordinary Lean `def … : Prop`
appearing as an explicit hypothesis; **none is proved; each is an infinite statement about cubic multigraphs**:

| Hypothesis | Plain words |
|---|---|
| `FEEXTD10` | far-exchange **extension**: for a cyclically 4-edge-connected simple cubic graph Q on ≥ 10 vertices with digons inserted on a set D of edges (Q^D on ≥ 16 vertices), every perfect matching M of Q^D that has a "far-exchange set" C extends to a star 6-colouring with colour classes M and C |
| `FEEXISTD18` | far-exchange **existence**: for such Q^D on ≥ 18 vertices, every edge and every status (in / out) is attained by a perfect matching that has a far-exchange set (the 16-vertex case is the theorem `feexist16`) |
| `POLE` | every "pole" of a 2-cut-reduced connected bridgeless cubic multigraph on ≥ 10 vertices is dominant (a statement about 3-edge-cut sides) |
| `TDTRI` | a restricted matching-colour-class property at a triangle side of a simple, 3-edge-connected, not cyclically 4-edge-connected cubic graph carrying exactly one digon edge |
| `FEEXTTNE16`, `FEEXIST0NE16` | the "leaf engine" on ≥ 16 vertices: extension and existence of far-exchange structures avoiding a prescribed eligible edge g, giving star 6-colourings of the leaf graph T(P, g) |
| `IID16` | the leaf case for hosts with ≥ 16 vertices (implied by the previous two) |
| `WEXT`, `TDLTRI` | route-B replacements of `POLE`, `TDTRI` |

Further conditional theorems: `RH2F.rh2_final : Hyp → II → DMS` (`Hyp`: every 2-cut-reduced connected bridgeless
cubic multigraph on ≥ 10 vertices is EX1-good; `II`: every leaf graph is star 6-colourable), and in the Lean-core
file `StarDMS2.lean`: `MGraph.dms_of_hole` (**HOLE ⇒ DMS**), `P05Lean.cubicSharp5_dms` (**CubicSharp5 ⇒ DMS**:
if every connected bridgeless loopless cubic multigraph other than K₃,₃, the prism and M₆ is star
5-edge-colourable, then DMS), `DmsIIsLean.cs5s_dms` (the same from the *simple* bridgeless cubic case alone),
`RH2F.layer4` / `star6_rh2_conditional`, `star6_ex1red_conditional`.

**T4 (unconditional finite certificates; kernel `decide`, no `native_decide`).**

| Theorem | Content |
|---|---|
| `RH2F.base12 : BASE12` | every 2-cut-reduced connected bridgeless cubic multigraph with 10 or 12 vertices is EX1-good (every perfect-matching status of every edge is realised by a colour class of a star 6-edge-colouring) |
| `RH2F.simple14 : SIMPLE14` | the same for every simple 3-edge-connected cubic graph on 14 vertices |
| `RH2F.b14d : B14D` | the same for every non-simple 2-cut-reduced one on 14 vertices |
| `RH2F.feexist16 : FEEXIST16` | far-exchange existence for all digon insertions with exactly 16 vertices |
| `layer37` part 5 (`IID16 → IID`) | the leaf case holds for all hosts with at most 14 vertices |
| `RH2F.cls16c` | every cyclically 4-edge-connected simple cubic graph on 16 vertices is isomorphic to one of 607 listed graphs |
| `RH2Fid.fidelity_bundle` | `(Hyp ↔ HP) ∧ (II ↔ IIP) ∧ (DMS ↔ DMSP)` plus sanity instances (K₄, K₃,₃, prism, Petersen, a digon graph: explicit star colourings and explicit non-star colourings) |
| `RH2P.layerP` | Schönberger's theorem for cubic multigraphs, from Mathlib's Tutte theorem (a **known** theorem; see section 5) |

### 1.5 Claimed completeness

**Partial advance, not a solution.** What is complete and formal: (i) DMS for explicit infinite families, mostly
with 5 colours (T1); (ii) DMS for all bridgeless cubic multigraphs up to 14 vertices and all subcubic multigraphs
up to 7 vertices, and an unconditional equivalence that localises the conjecture to cubic graphs on ≥ 16
vertices and their leaf graphs (T2); (iii) a kernel-checked reduction of DMS to named open hypotheses (T3) with
its finite base (T4). What is open: every hypothesis of T3; DMS itself.

### 1.6 Requested progress band (advisory; "a requested p is advisory", handbook §8.1)

**Requested: p = 0.15, as an explicit choice of the lower end of band P3; fallback P2 with p = 0.10.** We do not
request more.

Rationale, written to be conservative:

* **What supports P2** ("nontrivial lemma, reduction, reformulation, finite classification, or improvement short
  of the central obstacle", .05–.15). T3 is a nontrivial reduction (98 kernel-checked modules) and T2 item 5 is an
  unconditional reformulation; T4 and T2 items 1–4 are finite classifications with formal certificates. This part
  is solid on its own: it does not depend on any novelty claim about the families, and the literature check found
  no published reduction of the 6-colour conjecture to cubic graphs (section 2.6). We consider the upper half of
  P2 justified by the reductions and the equivalence together.
* **What supports the step to P3** ("meaningful infinite family, special case, bound, or structural advance
  removing a recognized obstacle", .15–.35). T1 proves the conjecture — with one colour to spare — for infinite
  families that are standard test classes for colouring conjectures on cubic graphs: the two classical infinite
  snark families (flower, Goldberg), all generalized Petersen graphs with k ≤ 15, Möbius ladders, and an inflation
  operation applicable to every cubic multigraph. Rows A, B, F, G and the uncovered part of row E are, as far as
  our literature check goes, new mathematics and not only formalization; row E proves a published conjecture
  (Zhu–Shao 2021) for k ≤ 15. This matches the wording "meaningful infinite family, special case".
* **Why only the lower end of P3, and what is not justified.** (a) None of the families removes an obstacle to
  the general conjecture: they are special cases proved by explicit periodic colourings, and the bound 5 for them
  says nothing about the graphs that need 6. (b) The reduction chain is conditional; its hypotheses carry the
  central burden, are open from 16 vertices on, and one natural strengthening that we studied informally is
  refuted (section 3.3). No "recognized obstacle" is removed. (c) The small-order theorems reach 14 vertices,
  while an informal computer search before the event already found no counterexample among ≈ 30.7 M graphs
  (cubic n ≤ 22); the formal theorems are certificates for a range in which nobody expected a counterexample.
  (d) Part of row E and all of rows D and the cover theorem are known in print. For these reasons **P4 or more is
  not justified** ("major cases or components carrying a substantial part of the logical burden" does not apply),
  and within P3 only the handbook default, the lower end, is requested.
* If the judges do not regard the families as "meaningful" in the sense of P3, or find them known, the
  contribution is the reductions, the equivalence and the finite theorems: band P2, where we would argue for
  p = 0.10 and not object to the lower end.
* Informal material (section 3) is offered as context only. We ask for no credit for anything that is not
  Lean-checked, following the organisers' guidance that formalization of every score-bearing claim is "not
  necessarily [required] but extremely encouraged".

### 2.2 Environment and reproduction

Toolchain: **Lean 4.33.1** (commit 819816b2e0a3bf405af45ae5c7af2491d8f5bee6), **Mathlib tag `v4.33.1`** (commit
0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474), pinned in `lean/pack3/lean-toolchain` and `lake-manifest.json`.
`StarDMS2.lean` needs Lean core only. All measurements: one Linux server, 2026-10-01/02.

```bash
# T3 + T4 (the chain): lake project, Mathlib oleans are downloaded, not compiled
cd lean/pack3
lake update && lake exe cache get && lake build      # 98 modules + Main; the 18 `#print axioms` lines are in the output
# measured: clean build, one worker, 20 min wall; log: lake_build.log (rc=0, "Build completed successfully")

# the same, per module (this is the build that pack4/pack5 link against: it writes build/*.olean)
bash setup.sh && bash run433.sh                       # then Main.lean -> build/axioms.log, audit -> build/audit_all.tsv
python3 check_headers3.py                             # statements unchanged against the Lean 4.20 originals
# measured: 98/98 modules, 0 errors, 1 422 s of module time, largest process 3.2 GB

# T2 (corollaries): needs lean/pack3/build/*.olean from run433.sh
cd ../pack5 && python3 gen5.py && bash build5.sh      # about 20 s per module, < 3 GB
tail -n 1 logs/*.out                                  # rc=0 four times
grep -h "depends on axioms" logs/*.out | grep -v "\[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound\]"   # empty

# T1 (families): needs lean/pack3/build/*.olean from run433.sh
cd ../pack4 && bash build_all.sh                      # 125 modules, one process at a time
# measured: 125/125 rc=0, 930 s of compiler time, largest process 2.05 GB; writes axioms.log, build/summary.txt
python3 sanity_check.py                               # plain Python: edge lists vs textbook, snark checks, brute force

# Lean-core file (HOLE => DMS, CubicSharp5 => DMS, covers, RH2 layers 1-5)
cd ../pack2/lean433 && lean StarDMS2.lean             # 73 s, 2.8 GB peak; log: StarDMS2.log
```

`run433.sh`, `c.sh` and `build5.sh` find the compiler through `LEAN433` (default
`$HOME/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.33.1/bin/lean`) and pack3 through `PACK3` (default `../pack3`).
The scripts lost their executable bit in this repository (it was assembled on Windows); call them with `bash`.

### 2.3 Axioms

* **T3/T4** (`lean/pack3/build/axioms.log`, 18 `#print axioms` lines, the same 18 in `lake_build.log`): all
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
* **Whole-closure audit** (`lean/pack3/build/audit_all.tsv`: `collectAxioms` on each of the 4 924 theorems of
  the 98 modules): standard axioms only, with **one** exception, `MGraph.k4subdiv_star6` in the baseline module
  `StarCert` (`native_decide`; its axiom is `MGraph.k4subdiv_star6._native.native_decide.ax_1_1`). **It is not
  used by any claimed theorem.** Checked for this packet against the logs: (a) it is the only row of
  `audit_all.tsv` with a non-standard axiom, so no other theorem of the 98 modules depends on it; (b) the name
  `k4subdiv_star6` occurs in no source file of `pack3/src`, `pack4/src`, `pack5/src` other than its definition
  (`StarCert.lean`, line 66); (c) every `#print axioms` line of pack4 and pack5 is standard. In
  `StarDMS2.lean` the same statement is re-proved by kernel `decide` (`[propext, Quot.sound]`).
* **T2** (`lean/pack5/logs/*.out`): 39 `#print axioms` lines (32 + 3 + 4; `Star6Bounded.out` prints none, its
  theorems are covered through `Star6Corollaries`), all standard.
* **T1** (`lean/pack4/axioms.log`): 33 lines `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` and 3 lines "does not
  depend on any axioms" (`BlockStar.colourable_of_star`, `BlockStar.dms_iff`, `starFamily_dms`).
* **Lean-core file** (`StarDMS2.log`): 12 lines; `P06Lean.cover_main` and `MGraph.k4subdiv_star6`:
  `[propext, Quot.sound]`; the others standard.
* No `sorry` (no `sorryAx` in any log), no `axiom` declaration. The word `native_decide` occurs in `pack3/src`, `pack4/src`, `pack5/src`
  only at `StarCert.lean:66` and in three comments of baseline modules. All certificate checks of the claimed
  theorems are `decide` / `decide +kernel` (evaluation by the Lean kernel).

### 2.4 Statement-correspondence note

Full note: `docs/star6_statement_correspondence.md` (objects and the 09-28 theorems; its line numbers refer to
the earlier bundle `StarDMS.lean`), `lean/pack2/STATEMENTS.md` (the chain), `lean/pack4/README.md` §2 (families),
`lean/pack5/README.md` (vocabulary). Summary:

| Lean | Mathematics |
|---|---|
| `structure MGraph` : `n m : Nat`, `ends : Fin m → Fin n × Fin n` | finite multigraph, vertices `Fin n`, edges `Fin m`; only the unordered pair of ends is used; parallel edges are distinct elements of `Fin m` |
| `Loopless G` | no edge has equal ends |
| `Subcubic G` | no vertex has 4 distinct incident edges (Δ ≤ 3) |
| `P : Fin G.m → Prop` | an edge set = the sub-multigraph it spans; `fun _ => True` is G itself |
| `Adj a b` | edges a ≠ b share an endpoint (parallel edges are adjacent) |
| `Walk4`, `Bicol c w` | a walk v0 e1 v1 e2 v2 e3 v3 e4 v4 with v0..v3 pairwise distinct and v1..v4 pairwise distinct, i.e. a path with 4 edges or a 4-cycle; bicoloured: c e1 = c e3 and c e2 = c e4 |
| `Star k c` / `StarOn P k c` | c is proper (on P) and no `Walk4` (with all edges in P) is bicoloured — the OPG definition "no path or cycle of length four is bi-colored" |
| `Colourable P k` | some `c : Fin m → Fin k` has `StarOn P k c`; for simple G and P = everything: χ′ₛ(G) ≤ k |
| `RH2F.DMS` | section 1.1 |
| `Star6.dms_iff_plain : DMS ↔ RH2Fid.DMSP` | `DMSP := ∀ (V E : Type) [Fintype V] [Fintype E] (en : E → Sym2 V), LooplessP en → MaxDeg3 en → Star6P en` — the same conjecture written independently with `Sym2` incidences, `deg en x ≤ 3`, colours 1..6, and separate clauses for 4-edge paths and 4-cycles (`RH2Fid.StarP`) |
| `BlockStar.dms_iff : RH2F.DMS ↔ ∀ G, DMSfor G` | `DMSfor G := G.Subcubic → G.Loopless → ∀ P, MGraph.Colourable P 6`; each T1 family theorem proves `DMSfor G` for its graphs |
| `Star6.IsStarEdgeColouring (G : SimpleGraph V) c` | `StarP (edgeEn G) c` with `edgeEn G : G.edgeSet → Sym2 V`; used by the `simple_…` theorems, together with `G.IsRegularOfDegree 3`, `G.degree v ≤ 3`, `Star6.Bridgeless G := ∀ e ∈ G.edgeSet, ¬ G.IsBridge e` |

No hidden hypotheses: all of the above are `def`s and `structure`s of the library. Not formalized: a statement
"DMS for all Mathlib `SimpleGraph`s" as such (the `SimpleGraph` theorems are the small-order ones), and the
converse passage from simple graphs to multigraphs.

### 2.5 Derivation summary

* **T3/T4.** Perfect matchings exist with prescribed status at any edge (Schönberger, `layerP`). DMS reduces to
  cubic bridgeless multigraphs plus a leaf case ((I) ∧ (II)); the cubic case is strengthened to "EX1-good" and
  reduced along 2-edge-cuts to 2-cut-reduced graphs (`Hyp → II → DMS`); these are reduced along 3-edge-cuts
  (poles, triangles) and digon suppression to digon insertions of cyclically 4-edge-connected simple hosts, where
  the two far-exchange hypotheses produce the colourings. The finite base (10, 12, 14 vertices; small hosts;
  16-vertex existence) is certified by generated tables checked with `decide +kernel`.
* **T2.** The same inductions with all hypotheses restricted to order ≤ N; at N = 14 the hypotheses are the T4
  theorems. The converse direction of `dms_iff_cubic16` applies DMS to sub-multigraphs.
* **T1.** `BlockStar.star_of_windows`: for a cyclic block graph with jumps ≤ D, if every window of 3D+1
  consecutive blocks passes a Boolean check, the block-wise colouring is a star colouring. The colourings are
  "periodic part + seam", so (lemmas by `omega`) every window of every n occurs for one of finitely many small
  n, and those are checked by `decide +kernel`. Rows E and G have no informal proof: the colourings were found
  by SAT search (`search/`), and the Lean proof is the proof.

### 2.6 References and literature status

Sources of the assessment: `docs/NOVELTY.md` (2026-10-01; reduction chain, families A–D, F) and a check made for
this packet on 2026-10-02 for rows E and G. "Verified" = the source was opened by us; "unverified" = known only
through another paper's summary or a search snippet.

* **DMS is open.** Verified: arXiv listing by the phrases "star edge colo(u)ring" / "star chromatic index"
  (arXiv API, 2026-10-02): the newest papers are arXiv:2511.13140 (Hu–Tang, cubic Halin graphs, Nov 2025) and
  arXiv:2410.15024; nothing later; both call the conjecture open.
* **Row E (generalized Petersen graphs).**
  - Verified (abstract and introduction of arXiv:2410.15024, Omoomi–Vahid Dastjerdi, 19 Oct 2024, v1; no
    journal version found): Zhu–Shao (Discuss. Math. Graph Theory 41(2) (2021), DOI 10.7151/dmgt.2195) proved
    χ′ₛ(GP(n,k)) = 4 iff n ≡ 0 (mod 4) and k odd; χ′ₛ ≤ 5 for d = gcd(n,k) ≥ 3 except when d = 3, k ≠ 3 and
    n/3 ≡ 1 (mod 3); for n even, k odd, d = 1; for k = 1, n ≥ 5; for k = 2, n ≡ 0 (mod 6); χ′ₛ(GP(3,1)) = 6; and
    they **conjectured χ′ₛ(GP(n,k)) ≤ 5 for all n > 2k except GP(3,1)**. Omoomi–Vahid Dastjerdi prove the
    conjecture for all d ≥ 3; for d = 2 when n ≡ 0 (mod 6), or n ≡ 2 (mod 6) and t ≡ 2 (mod 3), or n ≡ 4 (mod 6)
    and t ≡ 1 (mod 3) (t minimal with tk ≡ 2 mod n); and for n/d ∈ {2, 5}.
  - Unverified: the text of Zhu–Shao 2021 itself (known to us through the summary above and the Lei–Shi survey).
  - **Which of our instances (1 ≤ k ≤ 15, n ≥ 2k+1) are new**, relative to these results closed under the
    isomorphisms GP(n,k) ≅ GP(n,k′) (k′ ≡ ±k or kk′ ≡ ±1 mod n): **(a) all n odd with gcd(n,k) = 1 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 15,
    except GP(5,2)** (the Petersen graph) — infinitely many n for every k; **(b) gcd(n,k) = 2 (so k ∈ {2, 4, …,
    14}) outside the three d = 2 cases above and n/2 ∉ {2, 5}** — e.g. GP(8,2), GP(14,2), GP(14,4), GP(16,6).
    Known in print: k = 1; n even with k odd and gcd 1; gcd ≥ 3; the listed gcd-2 cases. By a script over
    n ≤ 400: 2 611 of the 5 760 pairs (n,k) are not covered in print (k = 1: 0; k = 2: 263 of 396; k = 3: 131 of
    394; k = 15: 98 of 370). So `gp_family` proves the Zhu–Shao conjecture for k ≤ 15, of which roughly 45 % of
    the instances are new.
  - Note: the abstract of arXiv:2410.15024 says its results "also prove [the DMS] conjecture for the generalized
    Petersen graphs"; this can only refer to the parameter classes it covers (the string "6-star" does not
    occur in its text). v3 of this packet said "DMS for generalised Petersen graphs is published … we make no
    claim about it"; that sentence is withdrawn. For the cases (a), (b) we found no published bound better than
    the general 7.
* **Row G (Möbius ladders).** Nothing found on star edge colourings of Möbius ladders (web searches of
  2026-10-02, the arXiv listing above, the Lei–Shi survey abstract). Nearby results, none covering M_n:
  Cartesian products of paths and cycles incl. prisms (Omoomi–Roshanbin–Vahid Dastjerdi, arXiv:1802.01300);
  ladders P_n □ K₂ (Fernando–Athapattu, Asian Res. J. Math. 21(9) (2025) 37–43 — unverified, search snippet
  only). DMS 2013: χ′ₛ(K₃,₃) = 6 and a simple cubic graph has χ′ₛ = 4 iff it covers Q₃ (verified in NOVELTY.md).
  Status: **appears new; elementary** (a periodic colouring).
* **Rows A, B (flower and Goldberg snarks).** Re-checked 2026-10-02 (web search; arXiv listing): still no
  paper on the star *edge* chromatic index of snarks. The literature on these snarks concerns normal
  5-edge-colourings (Sedlar–Škrekovski 2024), circular chromatic index, and star *vertex* colourings. The "good
  edge" of our informal proofs is the *rich edge* of normal colourings (Jaeger). Status: **appears new**.
* **Rows C, D, F, covers, the reductions, the finite certificates:** `docs/NOVELTY.md` rows #1–#18. In short:
  the reductions (T3), the EX1 / far-exchange machinery, and T4 appear new; pulling star colourings back along
  covers is DMS's own argument (known); GP(30m,14) fully and the other D families partly known.
* **Checked, no conflict:** Deng–Liu–Feng, Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. 48(4) (2025) art. 93, construct
  infinitely many cubic graphs with χ′ₛ = 6; by their Thm 3.1 these have connectivity 1, hence a bridge, so the
  hypotheses of CubicSharp5 / CubicSharp5_s (bridgeless graphs) are untouched (as recorded in v3).
* A public GitHub repository, `vibemathing/problem-opg-37271-star-chromatic-index-cubic`, is another AI attempt
  at the same problem; not literature; disclosed for priority; contents not reviewed by us.

### 2.7 Trust dependencies and disclosed deviations

1. **Lean kernel and Mathlib v4.33.1** (downloaded olean cache; Mathlib is not recompiled). Three modules
   import Mathlib directly (`SimpleGraph.Tutte`, `BigOperators.Fin`, `Sym2`/`Fintype`/`Cardinal.Finite`);
   pack4's `Families`/`All` import `Mathlib`. [**TODO(operator)**: confirm with the organisers that a Mathlib
   dependency is acceptable.]
2. **Port 4.20 → 4.33.1, compatibility options.** The chain was written and gate-checked on Lean 4.20.0 +
   Mathlib v4.20.0 and ported: 15 proof hunks in 8 modules (`lean/pack3/patches/*.patch`), the line
   `set_option backward.isDefEq.respectTransparency false` at the top of 73 modules (`patches/compat.txt`), and
   `set_option maxRecDepth 200000` in the 13 certificate modules of layers 36–37 and before two theorems
   (`patches/recdepth.txt`). These options affect elaboration only; the kernel checks the resulting terms. A
   header check over 6 124 declarations finds no changed statement (`check_headers.out`).
3. **Per-module builds for pack4 and pack5.** They are not lake targets: `c.sh` / `build5.sh` call `lean -o`
   module by module against `pack3/build/*.olean` (produced by `run433.sh`, not by `lake build`). The lake
   alternative described in `lean/pack5/README.md` (add the files to `pack3/src` and to `roots`) was **not run**.
4. **Graph-family fidelity (T1).** The families are explicit edge lists (`BlockStar.BG_ends` is the read-back
   theorem). That these lists are the textbook graphs is checked by `sanity_check.py` (plain Python, J_5, J_7,
   G_5, M_5, GP(5,2) and one inflation), **not** by a formal isomorphism with a textbook or Mathlib definition.
   `Subcubic` and `Loopless` are proved; "simple" and "cubic" are not formalized for the families. The Goldberg
   edge list follows the block description of arXiv:2511.08664 and was not compared with Goldberg's 1981 paper.
5. **Generated sources.** The certificate modules of pack3, most modules of pack4 and `Star6Bounded.lean` are
   generated; the generators are included, but those of pack4 rows D need the project's fact files, which are
   not in the repository. The generated Lean text is what is checked.
6. **Inflation (row F)** is formalized only for the Petersen piece, not for the general "all-good pieces" form
   of the informal fact.
7. **Statements unchanged by GPT-written proofs.** `InflationA–E`, `Inflation`, `Star6Equiv`, `Star6Simple`
   were written by GPT against statements fixed beforehand by Claude and re-checked afterwards.
8. `lean/pack2/STATEMENTS.md`, `INVENTORY.md`, `README.md` describe the state of 2026-10-01 (chain on Lean
   4.20 only; audit of 4 903 theorems); the 4.33.1 state is in `lean/pack3/README.md` (4 924 theorems).

---

## 3. Supporting material that is NOT formalized

**Verification level of everything in this section: none of it is Lean-checked, and no human has checked it.**
"Verified fact" below means: accepted by an LLM verifier (Claude Opus), and for most facts also passed a
cross-check audit by a second model family (GPT). That is evidence, not proof (handbook §7.1: "model agreement
… is not proof"). Computations are Python/C/SAT scripts run once on our server; "exhaustive" describes the
script's intent and was not independently re-run. **No credit is requested for this section.**

### 3.1 The fact graph (informal lemmas)

Project store on our server (`fact_graph/`, not in the repository; available on request): **786 facts** (3 more
were revoked). Status records read from the store on 2026-10-02 (789 records, 3 of them marked "cited"): 732
verified by the LLM verifier + GPT cross-check audit (141 of them also passed the Lean 4.20 gate), 45 by the LLM
verifier only, 9 Lean-gate facts without audit; the field `human_approved` is empty for all. Over all audit runs the GPT auditor returned 627 × "correct", 37 × "wrong", 10 × "error";
disputed facts were repaired or superseded (some disputes are still open, e.g. LEAF-FLIP, CORE-FE; see
`informal/ROADMAP_2026-09-30.md`). The informal versions of T3 (ROOT-CS4: DMS ⇐ P18 ∧ P16 ∧ P14 ∧ P23 ∧ P19)
and of the families A–D, F are facts of this graph; their Lean counterparts are the theorems above.

Informal results that go beyond the Lean artifact (examples; ids are fact ids): POLE-16 `3462e827` (pole
dominance for 10–16 vertices), LMC14 `18134123` (leaf case ≤ 14 vertices; the Lean version is `layer37` part 5),
the reductions P14-RED `2612f169`, W-RED `1a864fdc`, REPAIR-SU `1dec6fb9`, TD-RED `b4e4863f` (reviewed in
`informal/p23-check_REPORT.md`), II-RED3 `8ae2e62b`.

### 3.2 Exhaustive computations (evidence store)

* Imported baseline (before the event, section 4.1): no counterexample among ≈ 30.7 M graphs (cubic n ≤ 22,
  subcubic n ≤ 17, multigraphs n ≤ 18/10).
* **PMU** (`informal/c4c-ext_REPORT.md`, evidence `071a1c01e5f8f204`). Statement: for every cyclically
  4-edge-connected simple cubic graph G on ≥ 10 vertices and **every** perfect matching M, some star 6-edge-colouring
  of G has M as a colour class. Evidence: 0 failures over all 193 521 perfect matchings of all such graphs with
  10 ≤ n ≤ 18 (exhaustive), 0 in 88 144 sampled matchings at n = 20/24/30/40; it fails only for K₃,₃ (all 6
  matchings) and for 5 of 16 matchings at n = 8. PMU is a conjecture; nothing about it is proved.
* Removable-edge criterion "Lemma NR" with an informal proof, and a 4-cycle reduction for matchings without a
  removable edge (`informal/c4c-norem_REPORT.md`, evidence `8a775f2914586165`): covers 678/678 such pairs at
  n = 16, 18 and 445/445 sampled at n = 20–28; false at n = 14 (2 pairs), so the base would have to include 14.
* Cyclic 4-edge-cut reduction by a K₂ gadget for sides on 8–12 vertices
  (`informal/c4c-4cut_REPORT.md`, evidence `6000f3309454e62b`); pole censuses
  (`informal/p23-pole_REPORT.md`, evidence `06e97298e91d0b57`); far-exchange census at 20 vertices
  (`informal/p16_REPORT.md`, evidence `09b68e4e0508283c`).

### 3.3 Negative results (informal, by explicit witnesses)

* **Fixed-radius repair is refuted** (`informal/c4c-ball_REPORT.md`). The induction step "every star
  6-colouring of G′ = G − e (suppressed) with a prescribed perfect-matching class extends to G by recolouring
  within radius r of e" is false at r = 2 for all 8 local shapes tested and at r = 3 for 6 of 8, by explicit
  cyclically 4-edge-connected graphs (n = 258–574; witnesses in the report's json files on the server). In every
  realised case one Kempe swap rescues. So an induction for PMU needs "for some colouring" or unbounded
  recolouring. PMU itself is untouched by this.
* (FE-ALLPM-D) at 20 vertices is refuted (two classes of bad perfect matchings; `informal/p16_REPORT.md`);
  TD-RED-POLE with threshold 10 is false, with threshold 12 it holds on everything tested
  (`informal/p23-pole_REPORT.md`).
* The baseline ledger lists 49 refuted or abandoned approaches ("every local / bounded-repair route is dead").

### 3.4 The paper draft

`paper/star6_partial.tex` / `.pdf` (10 pages, written by a Claude helper on 2026-09-30 from a fact-graph snapshot
of 374 facts): informal statements and proof sketches of the reduction chain and of families A–D, F. It
predates layers 32–37 in Lean (its abstract still lists three finite hypotheses as unformalized, which are now
the theorems `base12`, `simple14`, `b14d`), does not contain rows E and G or T2, and lists covers of the
Petersen graph and GP(2m,k) results that `docs/NOVELTY.md` identifies as known. Authors are a placeholder. It
is included as a reading aid, not as a claim.

---

## 4. Provenance

### 4.1 Baseline vs event delta

* **Baseline (before the freeze) — declared, not claimed as event work:**
  - the Lean library `lean/Star*.lean` (20 modules, core Lean 4.20, imported 2026-09-27); 12 of them are in
    the artifact (StarCore, StarCert, StarSix, StarReduce, StarLeaf, StarRigid, StarBottleneck, StarChecker,
    StarCompose, StarMatching, StarVizing, StarExtension);
  - the research notes imported with it: the handoff ledger `reference/handoff.md` (718 lines, sha256
    b438fdff327d…) with its reports and scripts. It records a pre-event investigation in which DMS stayed open:
    a machine-checked reduction layer (the baseline Lean library), about 30.7 M graphs verified star
    6-colourable by computer, a ledger of refuted routes, and three live routes. The event work started from
    this ledger. **TODO(operator)**: timestamped baseline commit hash; confirm with the team which ideas of the
    RH2 route, if any, were already in the handoff.
* **New during the event** (all accepted by the project's Lean gate; module dates 2026-09-27 23:24 UTC to
  2026-10-01 UTC):

  - 09-28 to 10-01, the RH2 chain: 86 modules of `lean/pack3`, from 7d291f6ca774e1da (layer 1) to
    ba4d9c5abd0afd83 (layer 37); the list with sizes is `lean/pack2/INVENTORY.md`;
  - the Lean 4.20 → 4.33.1 port of all 98 modules (10-01/02 KST): proof edits only (section 2.7).
  - Further modules exist in the library (layers 38a, 38a1, 38e_0–3: partial finite checks of the 16-vertex
    leaf case). They are not part of this packet.
* **Produced on 2026-10-01/02 (UTC), after draft v3:**
  - `lean/pack5` (T2), 2026-10-02 13:04–13:21 UTC: `Star6Bounded` (generated), `Star6Corollaries` (Claude),
    `Star6Equiv` and `Star6Simple` (GPT);
  - `lean/pack4` (T1), 2026-10-02 13:07–14:13 UTC: Lean proofs of the informal facts c97931f9caaa7c8b,
    32a017c12a0c87eb, aa607ed0bc83ecf0 (2026-09-27), f8e1edfe45707104, 6309f733d6da8cd6, a491fe56b9f2d831
    (09-28), 1262231d03310f70 (09-29), 2f8113cb26f31818, cab2712392b5deec (09-30); rows E and G entirely new on
    10-02 (SAT-found colourings; no informal predecessor);
  - the informal studies of section 3.2–3.3 (10-01/02) and the literature notes (10-01, 10-02).
  **TODO(operator)**: the informal facts of rows A, B, F are dated 2026-09-27; confirm that their time stamps
  are inside the competition window.

### 4.2 Overlap with other submissions

* The Schönberger / Petersen formalization (section 5) is claimed in the team's separate M2 packet, not here.
* The team's other packets (Ramsey multiplicity; Erdős/M2) concern unrelated targets.
* Other entrants: unknown to us. The public repository named in section 2.6 targets the same problem.
  **TODO(operator)**: check the dashboard for active work on OPG-37271.

### 4.3 AI / tool / compute disclosure

* **Proof search and informal mathematics:** an automated multi-agent harness (a fork of Danus) on the team's
  server, with Claude Code workers (Claude Opus / Sonnet).
* **Verification inside the harness:** an LLM verifier (Claude Opus), a cross-check audit on another model
  family (GPT, recorded as "GPT-5.6-sol" in v3), and the Lean gate (Lean 4.20 + Mathlib v4.20.0 during the run).
  The authoritative check of everything claimed is the Lean 4.33.1 kernel.
* **Lean proofs:** Claude (the chain; pack4 except inflation; `Star6Corollaries`); GPT via codex sessions on the
  server (recorded as "gpt-6-sol" in the pack READMEs) for `InflationA–E`, `Inflation`, `Star6Equiv`,
  `Star6Simple`. **TODO(operator)**: confirm the exact GPT model name/version (the two records differ).
* **Packaging:** Claude Code helper sessions (the 4.33.1 port, pack4, pack5, the literature notes, this packet and
  the repository).
* **Other tools:** Python 3, pysat/CaDiCaL (SAT searches for rows E, G and the informal studies), small C helpers.
* **Compute:** one Linux server and a laptop; subscription plans; no paid API beyond them. **TODO(operator)**:
  confirm, and state funding/credit sources.
* **Human checking:** **none so far.** No human has verified any proof, statement correspondence, literature
  claim or computation in this packet. **TODO(operator)**: record anything the team checks by hand.
* **Outside help / conflicts:** **TODO(operator)**.

### 4.4 Reproducibility limitations

* The builds were run on one machine only; no independent rerun. The repository was assembled from the server
  copies; `SHA256SUMS` of pack4 (311 files), pack5 and the 100 source files of pack3 were re-verified after the
  copy.
* pack4 and pack5 need the per-module build of pack3 (section 2.7, item 3).
* The SAT searches are not needed for the proofs and are not deterministic; their outputs (`search/*.json`)
  are included.
* The fact graph, the evidence store and the witness files of section 3 are not in the repository.
* Documents in the repository mention paths of our server (`/home/lead/…` in build logs, `~/danus-projects/star6`,
  `~/m_harness/harness`, `~/.venvs/mh`, `~/erdos-fc/work`); they are not needed for reproduction.

## 5. Mode M2 candidates from this library (cross-reference only)

The library contains formalizations of two classical theorems that are absent from Mathlib v4.33.1: **Schönberger's
theorem** (every edge of a connected bridgeless cubic (multi)graph lies in a perfect matching, and is avoided by
one) and **Petersen's theorem, connected case** — `RH2P.schoenberger`, `RH2P.pstat`, `Star6.schoenberger_in/out`,
`Star6.petersen`, `Star6.plain_schoenberger`, and in Mathlib `SimpleGraph` vocabulary `Star6.simple_schoenberger`,
`Star6.simple_petersen_connected`. They are **not claimed in this packet**; they are claimed in the team's separate
Erdős/M2 packet. Details: `docs/star6_m2_candidates.md`. Likewise the cover theorem `P06Lean.cover_main` is
known mathematics and at most an M2 item.

## 6. Publication authority and operator TODOs

**Publication authority.** **TODO(operator)**: attribution approval by all team members and permission to
release the materials under the competition terms. The repository is local and unpublished; nothing was pushed
or submitted by the writers of this packet.

**TODO list for the operator**

1. Team name, roster, class, affiliations, resource classification, contributions (section 1).
2. Submission ID; OPDP family ID and source snapshot; frozen difficulty D on the handbook's 0–1000 scale (v3
   recorded "5.4, atlas v1.5"); admission of the target as M3A.
3. Hill / Climb / evaluator report: none exists; ask the organisers which route applies to a Lean repository
   for a target without a committed Hill.
4. Publish the repository and replace the local commit hash by an immutable URL.
5. Ask whether the Mathlib dependency and the per-module builds of pack4/pack5 are acceptable.
6. Baseline: timestamped baseline commit; which RH2 ideas were in the handoff; competition-window check of the
   09-27 facts.
7. Confirm the GPT model name, the compute and funding statement, outside help and conflicts.
8. Human checking: at least the statement correspondence of section 1.1–1.3 and the Goldberg-snark edge list
   (against Goldberg 1981) should be read by a team member before submission.
9. Decide whether to keep the requested p = 0.15 (lower end of P3) or to request P2.
10. Literature: obtain Zhu–Shao 2021 and confirm the coverage list of section 2.6; optionally a second search
    for Möbius ladders in non-indexed journals.
11. Publication authority (above).
