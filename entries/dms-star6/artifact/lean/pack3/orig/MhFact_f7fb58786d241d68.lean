  NE1.lean — the no-enclosed-exchange (NE) closing set of the root in Lean: Theorem H-ENG-NE (fact b771fa70cbc11e0b)
  and Theorem ROOT-CS3 (fact 2d98b2523e97e6a0). Condition (d) (no enclosed exchange), the four far-exchange engine

  hypotheses (their proofs rest on exhaustive enumerations up to isomorphism, done outside Lean).
