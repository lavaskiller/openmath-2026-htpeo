      L < 10486266368 / 768 ^ 4
```

In words: c_4 ≤ P := 200080655744752337972227066537 / 6638390640717004439491700265361 ≈ 0.030139933996
(hill metric 30,139,933,996 ppt; 6638390640717004439491700265361 = 50759309^4), which is strictly below the
hill reference B* = 10486266368/768^4 = 20480989/679477248 ≈ 0.030142273432 (30,142,273,432 ppt). The
difference is B* − P ≈ 2.339·10^-6. Equivalently, for every m ≥ 4 some 2-colouring of K_m has at most a
fraction P of its 4-subsets monochromatic.

### 1.2 Claimed completeness

**Partial advance, not a solution.** This is an improved explicit upper bound for an open constant; c_4 is not
determined and the best known lower bound (0.0296 < c_4, Grzesik–Lee–Lidický–Volec, as cited in
arXiv:2206.04036) is untouched. The evaluator report itself says `parent_problem_resolved: false` and
`research_status: "candidate improvement on the frozen reference; novelty and formal review required"`.

What is complete: the stated inequality is fully formal end to end (the finite computation, the blow-up
lemma, monotonicity and existence of the limit), with standard axioms only and no `native_decide` in the
main chain.

### 1.3 Requested progress band (advisory; "a requested p is advisory", handbook §8.1)

**Requested: band P1, p = 0.05 (upper end of P1), explicitly not more than the lower end of P2.**

Rationale, written to be conservative:

* By the band table the contribution is a "narrow certified computation ... or reusable fact" (P1) or at most
  an "improvement short of the central obstacle" (P2). It is not a structural advance and removes no
  recognised obstacle (so not P3 or above).
* Size of the advance: the new bound lowers the hill reference by 2.34·10^-6 and Theorem 1.1 of
  arXiv:2206.04036 (4551721·2^-24·3^-2 ≈ 0.0301449) by 4.92·10^-6. The gap between the reference and the
  lower bound 0.0296 is ≈ 5.4·10^-4, so this closes about 0.43 % of the known gap. That is small, and the
  method (local search on blow-ups of the known 768-vertex Cayley construction) is the method of the cited
  paper and of McKay, not a new idea.
* Why the upper end of P1 rather than the lower end (the handbook default is the lower end unless a written
  rationale supports more): (i) the bound is, to our knowledge, below every published value, i.e. it is a new
  record for a classical constant and not only a verification; (ii) the statement is about c_4 itself — the
  blow-up lemma for arbitrary symmetric weighted templates (`ramseyMultK4_le_density`), monotonicity and
  existence of the limit are formalised and reusable for any later template of this schema; (iii) the
  computation is a kernel-checked certificate, not a compiled evaluation. If the judges do not accept this
  rationale, the lower end of P1 (p = 0.01) is the default and we do not object.
* We do **not** request P2 or more. If the canonical record's success criterion turns out to be "beat the
  frozen reference" (the hill reports `target_achieved: true`), the classification of that narrower target is
  the organisers' decision; we do not claim p = 1 for the c_4 problem.
* Caveat on novelty: we have not read the current hill leaderboard (see section 3.2). If another entrant holds
  a lower bound, the mathematical novelty of the number is reduced accordingly; the formalisation remains.

The report states its own trust boundary: "Python integer certificate check plus mathematical lifting lemma;
no approved proof-assistant acceptance is asserted". A passing hill is necessary but is not itself a
mathematical proof (handbook §7.2); the proof is the Lean project below.

### 2.1 Formal source layout (`lean/` in the artifact repository)

* Static, solution-independent sources: `RamseyCert/Defs.lean` (specification, packed evaluation),
  `Fast.lean` (packed evaluation = specification), `Limit.lean` (blow-up lemma, `ramseyMultK4`),
  `Mono.lean` (monotonicity, limit exists), `Sym.lean`, `SymDefs.lean` (symmetry check), `Summary.lean`
  (`#check` / `#print axioms`).
* Generated from `solution.json` by `tools/gen.py`: `RamseyCert/Data/*.lean` (weights, row masks, packed
  blocks), `Chunk/R{a}.lean`, `Chunk/B{a}.lean` (2048 files, one block and colour each, three
  `decide +kernel` facts per file), `SymChk0..7.lean`, `GlueR.lean`, `GlueB.lean`, `Main.lean`, `Final.lean`,
  `Native.lean` (cross-check only), `layers.txt`, `values.json`.
* 2103 `.lean` files in total (≈ 51 MB, mostly numerals). `tools/gen.py`, `tools/build.sh`,
  `tools/check_data.py`. Logs: `logs/Summary.log`, `logs/RamseyCert.{Main,Final,Fast,Limit,Mono,GlueR,GlueB,Native}.log`;
  `build_status.txt` (one line per module, 2112 lines with `rc=0`, none failed).

### 2.2 Environment and reproduction

Lean `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1` (`lean-toolchain`), Mathlib `v4.33.1`
(rev `0df444a360eaa60ab8c11dca51a86af692955474`, `lake-manifest.json`), Python 3 (numpy only for `gen.py`).

```bash
# (a) hill metric, pure Python, ~2-3 min (the hill's private audit fixtures are not needed for this)
python3 -c "
import sys, json; sys.path.insert(0, 'hill'); import eval as E
d = json.load(open('solution.json')); w, r = E._validate(d)
R, B, D = E._density(w, r); print(R, B, D, E._metrics(R, B, D))"

# (b) Lean certificate, ~50 min wall time on 6 cores, <= 3.3 GB per lean process
cd lean
lake exe cache get
python3 tools/gen.py solution.json .                                   # optional: regenerate (deterministic)
python3 tools/check_data.py solution.json RamseyCert/Data/Base.lean    # JSON -> Lean transcription check
bash tools/build.sh . RamseyCert 6                                     # 6th argument "noscope" without systemd

grep "depends on axioms" logs/RamseyCert.Main.log logs/RamseyCert.Final.log
```

(a) was re-run on the laptop from the artifact directory on 2026-10-02 (Python 3.12, 198 s): red numerator
99809658758227271141703184848, blue numerator 100270996986525066830523881689, denominator
6638390640717004439491700265361, `reference_beaten = 1`, `density_ppt = 30139933996` — identical to the
signed report. (b) was run once, on the server (build record in `lean/CERT_STATUS.md`); it has **not** been
re-run on a second machine.

### 2.3 Statement-correspondence note

* **`Template.numer` ↔ hill `_oracle`.** `hill/eval.py::_oracle` sums, over all ordered 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) of
  block indices *with repetition*, the product w_a w_b w_c w_d when the six entries
  `rows[a][b], rows[a][c], rows[a][d], rows[b][c], rows[b][d], rows[c][d]` are all `"1"` (red) or all `"0"`
  (blue); a repeated index reads the diagonal entry of `red_rows`. `Template.numer` is the same sum with
  `T.red` for `rows[·][·] == "1"`; `Template.density = numer / (Σ w)^4` is the hill's `exact_density`, and
  `sol_ppt` is the hill's rounding `density_ppt = ⌈10^12 · density⌉`. The hill's *fast* routine `_density`
  (which produced the official number) is **not** modelled in Lean; the hill audits `_density` against
  `_oracle` on its own fixtures, and the Lean value equals the report's `exact_density`, `red_numerator`
  and `blue_numerator` (`K4R`, `K4Bneg`).
* **`sol` ↔ `solution.json`.** `sol` is built from `wl` (weights, decimal) and `rowsR` (row masks, bit j of
  mask i = `red_rows[i][j]`) in `Data/Base.lean`. This transcription is done by `tools/gen.py` and is
  **not** proved in Lean; `tools/check_data.py` (40 lines, regular expressions, no code shared with the
  generator) re-checks it. The evaluator divides weights by their gcd; here the gcd is 1.
* **`minMonoK4` / `ramseyMultK4` ↔ the literature constant.** A 2-edge-colouring of K_m is a symmetric
  `c : Fin m → Fin m → Bool` (values on the diagonal are never used: `monoK4` only looks at pairs u ≠ v).
  `monoK4 c` counts 4-subsets all of whose 6 pairs have the same colour; `minMonoK4 m` is its minimum over
  colourings (k_4(m) in arXiv:2206.04036); `ramseyMultK4` is the liminf of k_4(m)/C(m,4).
  `ramseyMultK4_tendsto` proves that the liminf is the limit, so `ramseyMultK4` is c_4 as defined in the
  literature (lim k_t(n)/C(n,t)). That these three definitions say this is a matter of reading them — it is
  the residual statement-fidelity question for the reviewer.
* **Blow-up ↔ metric.** `blowup_count`: for a symmetric template and every t, the complete graph on
  t·Σw vertices (block i replaced by t·w_i vertices, colour of a pair = colour of the pair of blocks,
  diagonal entry inside a block) has `24 * monoK4 c ≤ t^4 * numer`. Hence `ramseyMultK4 ≤ density`
  (`ramseyMultK4_le_density`). This is the lifting lemma the hill refers to (`LIFTING.md` in the hill; we do
  not have that file locally).

### 2.4 Derivation summary

1. *Finite computation.* numer(sol) = K4(red) + K4(blue) (`Template.numer_eq`, `K4_blue`). For each colour,
   K4 = Σ_a w_a Σ_{b,c ∈ N(a), adj b c} w_b w_c · I(a,b,c), with
   I(a,b,c) = Σ_d [d common neighbour] w_d = (M_a AND M_b AND E_c) mod (2^32 − 1), where masks and weights are
   packed in 32-bit fields of 32768-bit naturals (valid since Σw = 50759309 < 2^32 − 1). `colour_total`
   (`Fast.lean`) proves that the packed evaluation equals the literal specification for every n and every
   weight vector under that side condition. The 2·1024 per-block values are proved by `decide +kernel`
   (kernel evaluation, no compiler), assembled in `GlueR/GlueB` → `sol_numer`, `sol_total`, `sol_density`.
2. *Comparison.* `sol_lt_ref`, `sol_ppt` by `norm_num` on the exact fraction.
3. *Symmetry.* `sol_symm` from `SymChk0..7` (bit j of row i = bit i of row j).
4. *Lifting.* `blowup_count` → `minMonoK4_le` → `ramseyMultK4_le_density` → `ramseyMultK4_le_sol`,
   `ramseyMultK4_lt_ref`.
5. *Limit.* `minMonoK4_density_mono` (vertex-deletion averaging) → `ramseyMultK4_tendsto`,
   `minMonoK4_density_le` → `minMonoK4_density_le_sol`, `ramseyMultK4_limit_lt_ref`.

### 2.5 References and literature status

Verified by us on 2026-10-01/02 against the arXiv text of 2206.04036 (ar5iv rendering):

* O. Parczyk, S. Pokutta, C. Spiegel, T. Szabó, *New Ramsey multiplicity bounds and search heuristics*,
  arXiv:2206.04036 (v1 8 Jun 2022, last revised 13 Sep 2024). Theorem 1.1: c_4 ≤ 4551721·2^-24·3^-2
  (< 0.03015; numerically 0.0301449), from the blow-up sequence of a Cayley graph on 768 vertices.
* The closing Note of that paper: McKay, by local search starting from that Cayley graph, found a 768-vertex
  graph with value 10486266368/768^4 = 0.0301422734319 (trivial automorphism group). **This is exactly the
  hill's reference** (`hill/eval.py`: "McKay improvement in the final note of arXiv:2206.04036v3").
* History as stated in that paper's introduction: Thomason c_4 < 0.030304 (disproving Erdős' conjecture
  c_4 = 1/32); Thomason 1997 c_4 < 0.030291; Even-Zohar and Linial c_4 < 0.030285; best lower bound
  0.0296 < c_4 by Grzesik, Lee, Lidický, Volec (flag algebras).

Not verified by us (second-hand or not checked at the source): the original papers of Thomason,
Even-Zohar–Linial and Grzesik et al. themselves (we rely on the citations above); Giraud's lower bound
(c_4 > 1/46) and other earlier lower bounds — **unverified, not relied upon**; whether any improvement on
McKay's value has been published or announced since September 2024 — **TODO(operator)**: literature check.

### 2.6 Axioms

`#print axioms` (`lean/logs/RamseyCert.Main.log`, `RamseyCert.Final.log`, `Summary.log`) for `sol_density`,
`sol_lt_ref`, `sol_ppt`, `sol_symm`, `ramseyMultK4_le_sol`, `ramseyMultK4_lt_ref`,
`minMonoK4_density_le_sol`, `ramseyMultK4_limit_lt_ref`: `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.
No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide` in the import closure of `Main.lean` / `Final.lean`.
`Native.lean` (uses `native_decide`) is a separate cross-check imported by nothing.

### 2.7 Trust dependencies (stated frankly)

1. **Lean 4.33.1 kernel, including its GMP-accelerated `Nat` arithmetic** (`Nat.land`, `Nat.mod`,
   `Nat.mul`, `Nat.shiftRight`, ... on 32768-bit literals). The whole finite computation rests on these
   kernel extensions via `decide +kernel`. This is standard kernel functionality, but it is a larger trusted
   base than pure reduction, and whether `decide +kernel` at this scale is inside the verification chair's
   allowed trust boundary is for the chair to say. **TODO(operator)**: ask.
2. **Mathlib v4.33.1.**
3. **JSON → Lean transcription** by `tools/gen.py` (not verified in Lean; independent re-check with
   `tools/check_data.py`). All generated files are in the repository, so the reviewer checks what is there;
   the generator need not be trusted except for this correspondence.
4. **Per-module build instead of a single `lake build`.** The 2112 modules were compiled one by one with
   `lean -o` by `tools/build.sh` in dependency layers (`layers.txt`), because each chunk file needs ≈ 1.6 GB
   private memory. A full-size `lake build` was **not** run. Every module's exit status is in
   `build_status.txt`. The partial rebuild at 12:23–12:24 UTC (after `Mono.lean` and two corollaries were
   added to `Final.lean`) re-ran layers from 3 upward; modules whose dependencies were unchanged were not
   recompiled. An organiser rerun from scratch is the clean check of this point.
5. **Hill `_density` vs `_oracle`**: not modelled (section 2.3); equality of the numbers was observed, not
   proved.
6. **No independent rerun** of the Lean build on a second machine, and **no human check** (section 3.4).

### 2.8 Code and certificates

Artifact repository layout: `solution.json`, `runs/report_1ab2354d.json`, `runs/ledger_server.tsv`,
`hill/eval.py`, `lean/`, `search/v2/`, `search/v1/`, `README.md`, `ramsey_packet.md`, `SHA256SUMS`.

## 3. Provenance

### 3.1 Baseline vs event delta

Handbook: the common baseline / status freeze is noon Eastern on 27 September 2026 (= 16:00 UTC); only
mathematics contributed inside the competition window (to 00:00 EDT, 3 October) is event output.

* **Pre-existing (baseline, not claimed):** the problem; the 768-vertex Cayley construction (Parczyk et al.)
  and McKay's 768-vertex graph and value; the hill, its evaluator and its seed solution (organisers);
  Lean and Mathlib; the team's general agent harness. No Ramsey-specific code, search result or Lean code of
  ours existed before the freeze, to the best of our records: the earliest file in the working tree is dated
  2026-09-28 (hill copy and seed, 14:25 local time).
* **Event work, 2026-09-28/29** (same Autolab project, earlier experiments): baseline run, local search on
  the seed, weight refinement, symmetric (orbit) search — code in `search/v1/`. According to the operator one
  experiment of 09-29 already reported `reference_beaten = 1`. These are inside the event window, so they are
  event output, superseded by the present result (revisions replace, they do not stack). We did not read the
  Autolab records ourselves: experiment IDs, their exact metric values and timestamps are
  **TODO(operator)**.
* **Event work, 2026-10-02:** the search that produced `solution.json` (`search/v2/`, ledger
  `runs/ledger_server.tsv`), the official evaluation (report timestamp 2026-10-02T11:38:08Z), and the whole
  Lean certificate (design, generator, static files, build; 09:10–12:35 UTC per `lean/CERT_STATUS.md`).
* **Baseline commit:** there is no timestamped pre-event baseline commit of this work, because the work did
  not exist; the working tree was not under version control during the event, so the artifact repository has
  only the final commit(s). The time evidence is file timestamps, the server ledger, the signed report and
  the Autolab experiment history. **TODO(operator)**: confirm that this is acceptable or supply the Autolab
  history as the timestamped record.
* **Explicit new-work delta relative to the status freeze:** the 1024-block template `solution.json`
  (improving McKay's value by 2.34·10^-6), and the Lean development `RamseyCert`.

Search method (for reproducibility; none of it is trusted by the proof): start from the hill's 768-vertex
Cayley seed; compute its automorphism group and the orbits on vertex pairs; restrict flips to the 28 "soft"
orbits (those where flips occur); compound-move simulated annealing / tabu with all flip deltas kept in
tables (`sa.py`, `run.py`, `tabu.c`); split blocks to reach 1024 blocks (near-twin splits, `twin.py`,
`split*.py`); float weight optimisation (exponentiated gradient / L-BFGS) and rounding to integer weights
≤ 65535; basin hopping (SA phase → quench → weight refit, `jobY.sh`); every candidate re-scored exactly with
the hill's own evaluator code (`verify.py` → ledger). Seeds and parameters are in the job scripts.
Limitation: the search is randomised and time-limited; re-running it is not expected to reproduce the same
template, and is not needed — the template itself is the certificate.

### 3.2 Overlap with other submissions

* Other entrants: **unknown.** A leaderboard snapshot of 27 September, known to us only second-hand, had the
  leader at 30,141,720,824 ppt (above our 30,139,933,996). **We have not read the current leaderboard.**
  We have not seen any other entrant's solution or method. **TODO(operator)**: read the leaderboard and state
  the position at submission time.
* Our own other submissions: none in this family other than the earlier experiments of this project.

### 3.3 AI / tool / compute disclosure

* **Search code and Lean certificate engineering** (specification `Defs.lean`, `Sym.lean`, generator, build
  tooling, glue, documentation, this packet): written by Claude (Anthropic, model `claude-opus-5-5`) in
  Claude Code agent sessions on a team laptop, operating a remote server.
* **Three general Lean lemma files** — `Fast.lean`, `Limit.lean`, `Mono.lean` — proved by GPT (`gpt-6-sol`
  via the codex CLI), against statements fixed beforehand by the Claude agent; the files were recompiled
  independently and the statements compared with the prescribed ones (by the agent, not by a human).
* **Other tools:** Python 3 / numpy, a small C extension (`tabu.c`), Lean 4.33.1, Mathlib v4.33.1, the
  hill's evaluator code, the Autolab CLI for the official evaluation (run by the operator side, not by the
  writer of this packet).
* **Compute:** one 16-core server (14 GB RAM); search ≈ 12 hours wall time on that server; certificate
  16762 s ≈ 4.7 CPU-hours (50 minutes wall). No GPU was used by the search code, as far as the sources show.
  Funding / credits / whether the server or the model subscriptions are company resources (this affects the
  entrant class): **TODO(operator)**.
* **Human checking so far: none.** No human has checked the Lean statements, the proofs, the transcription,
  the statement correspondence or the literature paragraph. Humans supervised the agents. The Lean kernel
  checked the proofs. **TODO(operator)**: at least one human read of section 1.1 and 2.3.
* Outside help: none known to us. Conflicts of interest: **TODO(operator)**.

### 3.4 Reproducibility limitations

* Certificate build needs ≈ 4.7 CPU-hours and ≥ 3.3 GB per process; not re-run on a second machine.
* Per-module build (section 2.7, item 4).
* Full hill `eval()` needs the hill's private fixtures, which we do not have; the counting code is callable
  directly (section 2.2 a).
* Search not bit-reproducible (section 3.1).

### 3.5 Inconsistencies between our own records (recorded, not resolved)

* `lean/CERT_STATUS.md` draft cites the paper's bound as "c_4 ≤ 0.03014"; the paper's Theorem 1.1 is
  4551721·2^-24·3^-2 ≈ 0.0301449 (< 0.03015). This packet uses the paper's value.
* Clock: `runs/ledger_server.tsv` records the final solution at "10-02 19:52" (server local time, zone not
  recorded), `CERT_STATUS.md` says it was verified at 11:12 UTC, the Lean build started 11:18 UTC and the
  signed report is 11:38:08 UTC. If the ledger is in KST (UTC+9) the ledger time is 10:52 UTC, 20 minutes
  before the CERT_STATUS statement. The order of events is consistent; the exact minute is not.
* `CERT_STATUS.md` says "submit the hill solution (not done by this helper)" and was last updated 12:35 UTC,
  while the signed report is dated 11:38 UTC — the status file was not updated after the submission.
* The report has `final: false` and mode `validation` (with `official: true`). Whether a `final`/test-mode
  evaluation is required by the competition workflow: **TODO(operator)**.
* The report's `submission_hash` (`8ff65791...`) is not the sha256 of `solution.json` (`b0eae3d4...`);
  presumably it hashes the submission tree. We could not confirm that the merged submission's
  `solution.json` is byte-identical to ours; the identical `exact_density`, numerators, block count and
  weight sum make a different template implausible. **TODO(operator)**: confirm from commit `fa5e815`.
* The task description for this packet expected a hill README next to `eval.py`; the local hill copy has only
  `eval.py` (no README, no `LIFTING.md`, no `private/`).
* `lean/SHA256SUMS` was made on the server; the top-level `SHA256SUMS` of the artifact repository is the
  authoritative one for the published files.

## 4. Publication authority

**TODO(operator).** Attribution approval by all roster members, and permission to release the materials
(solution, Lean sources, tools, search code, disclosures, this packet) under the competition terms, must be
given by the entrant's humans; the writer of this packet (an AI agent) cannot grant it. If the entry is a
company entry, authorisation to represent the company is also required. AI systems acquire no authorship
(handbook §10.1).

---

## 5. TODO list for the operator

1. **Roster / class**: all human members, entrant class (individual / team / company), affiliations,
   resource classification, each human's contribution; conflicts of interest.
2. **Human check**: read the Lean definitions and theorem statements (section 1.1) and the correspondence
   note (2.3); ideally re-run the certificate build on a second machine; check the literature paragraph (2.5),
   in particular for improvements after September 2024.
3. **Organiser admission + D**: confirm the canonical problem/family ID, modality (M3A proposed; M1 if in the
   focus set), open status at the freeze, and the frozen difficulty D(P). Ask the verification chair whether
   `decide +kernel` with GMP kernel arithmetic and a per-module build are inside the allowed trust boundary.
4. **Immutable public commit URL**: publish the artifact repository (local commit `493882e2e599d6e11a5c93301bc46d48eb58b2d5` plus the
   follow-up packet commit) and record the immutable URL; add the competition submission ID and the climb URL.
5. **Publication authority** (section 4).
6. Autolab record: IDs, metrics and timestamps of the 09-28/29 experiments (baseline, local search, weight
   refinement; which one first had `reference_beaten = 1`); whether a `final` evaluation is needed; confirm
   that the merged `solution.json` at `fa5e815` has sha256 `b0eae3d4...da441`.
7. Read the current hill leaderboard and record our position and any overlap with other entrants.
8. Compute / funding disclosure (server ownership, model subscriptions or credits).
9. Submit through the published competition workflow before 00:00 EDT, 3 October 2026. **Nothing has been
   submitted, pushed or sent by the writer of this packet.**

## Addendum (2026-10-02 22:20 KST): items resolved after the packet was written

* **Byte identity of the submitted file.** The `solution.json` in the Autolab workspace from which experiment `1ab2354d` was submitted has sha256 `b0eae3d46cf41d2db1a9…`, the same as `solution.json` in this repository (checked on the submitting machine). The report's `submission_hash` therefore hashes something other than the bare file (presumably the submission tree).
* **Autolab experiment history of the project** `lavaskiller/clique-cluster-ramsey-multiplicity-attempt-16` (from `autolab log`):

  | experiment | date | status | reference_beaten | title |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `f13f7e00` | 2026-09-28 | merged | 0 | Baseline run |
  | `4c734185` | 2026-09-28 | merged | 0 | local-search… |
  | `2b482245` | 2026-09-28 | failed | – | integer-blo… |
  | `a3e68347` | 2026-09-29 | merged | 0 | weights-ref… |
  | `0bcf1970` | 2026-09-29 | merged | 1 | weights-converged-beats-Bstar (768 blocks, weights only) |
  | `1ab2354d` | 2026-10-02 | merged | 1 | blowup-1024-ppt-30139933996 (this packet) |

  The first experiment with `reference_beaten = 1` is `0bcf1970` (2026-09-29); its density_ppt was not recorded by us (TODO(operator): read it from the project page). All experiments are after the event start; none predates 2026-09-28.
* **Leaderboard.** The operator reported on 2026-10-02 (evening, KST) that this entry is in first place on the hill leaderboard; we have not recorded the leaderboard page itself (TODO(operator): screenshot or link).
